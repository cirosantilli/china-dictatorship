[[about]]
== About (关于)

This repo has the following goals:

* allow copy pasting links to answers to questions/comments that have been posted a million times before by <<wumao>>, mostly under: <<faq>>. This was the original goal.
* serve as a censorship bomb to block <<github>> in China: <<keyword-attack>> to destroy the <<gfw>> and <<dictator-needs-gfw,therefore the CCP>>. Or more realistically get added to the <<github-gov-takedowns>> hall of fame.
* be a fun and sometimes silly source of Chinese mostly anti-CCP culture like a better https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/China[Unencyclopedia] / https://web.archive.org/web/20191209021646/http://encyclopediadramatica.rs/China[Encyclopedia Dramatica] without the stupid stereotype jokes. Just quickly browse the pictures with Ctrl + F "Figure" and have fun.
* serve as a place where people can post interesting related stuff in the issues: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues see also: <<shitpost>>
* highlight positive about China's culture outside of its shitty government, such as <<the-best-chinese-supermarket-food-products,food>> and <<music>>. This has two goals:
** teach foreigners (maybe even Chinese people on certain points) about amazing Chinese things that they can consume
** show wumaos that <<ciro-santilli>> is not as clueless about China as they think

== Copypasta

Here's an image/sentence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copypasta[copypasta]/summary of key events for the <<keyword-attack>>.

Another advantage of this is that since it comes first in the repo, it ensures that key elements show up on github.com despite file size cutups: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610[].

Each summary section contains a link to the main section, which contains sources and description of each image.

[[mirrors]]
== Mirrors of this page (此网页的镜像)

You can download the webpage locally from GitHub at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/archive/gh-pages.zip

Media such as images are not stored in this repository, but rather at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media to keep the lightweight clone. That downloaded HTML will read images from that repository, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg[]. But we've learnt after creating that maybe the raw.githubusercontent.com subdomain is censored: <<github-censored-subdomains>>. If anyone can confirm, we will start using another image provider by default.

Clone locally with Git using GitHub images:

....
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
cd china-dictatorship
git checkout gh-pages
xdg-open README.html
....

Build it yourself:

....
bundle install
make
xdg-open README.html
....

Build and view the multipage version:

....
make multipage
xdg-open out/multipage/README.html
....

Build with GitLab served images:

....
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
cd china-dictatorship
make MEDIA=MEDIA=https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/-/raw/master
....

Build with local images:

....
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media
cd china-dictatorship
make MEDIA=../china-dictatorship-media
....

or build to use GitLab images:

Given <<github-censored-subdomains>>, this might be the only way to view the images from China.

The cool thing about Git is that we can maintain several mirrors on multiple websites very easily:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship Canonical source and rendered output. If ever <<github-gov-takedowns>> we do this: <<strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns>>
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-2 mirror in case they block just https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship[], see also: <<strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns>>. Active renaming in place due to <<chinese-web-browser-censorship>>
* https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli[]: a mirror just so that some interesting stuff will show up at https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli[]. The policy is to transfer any <<wumao>> issues from there to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship[]. Interestingly, https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli/issues/53 from that project because the second yandex.com hit for "六四事件" as of 2022/04/17, and the only one that is not yet censored in China entirely, which drives reasonable traffic (3500 hist / 2 weeks).
* https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
** their gitlab.com render is shit for some reason, clicking on the ToC does not jump to headers properly, not sure why, IDs look correct
** one really cool thing about gitlab is that it can serve images from directly gitlab.com e.g. https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/-/raw/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg unlike GitHub which has the `raw.` subdomain: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg This makes it impossible to block the GitLab images without blocking all of gitlab.com, until GitLab starts a <<github-gov-takedowns,gov-takedowns>> of their own.
** https://cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship GitLab Pages. Works fine. Let's see if they can block subdomains: https://zh.greatfire.org/https/cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship
** Maybe some day https://gitlab.cn/ ? :-) Edit 2021-03, yup, it happened, with <<icp-license>> and all

They also have a few Chinese students every year, that's how Ciro met <<wife>>, it will be fun when those students see this.

Mirrors controlled by other people, thus forming a type of <<samizdat>>:

* https://git.kiwifarms.net/CrunkLord420/china-dictatorship auto-pull Gitea mirror on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms[Kiwi Farms], a <<politically-incorrect,politically incorrect>> social network website
* https://china.vkoor.com/ presumably by https://github.com/Vkoor[] who is a collaborator of this project, e.g. https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/533[]. They're also hosting a search engine proxy at https://www.vkoor.com/[], TODO Google? See also: <<google-mirrors>>.
* https://github.com/cheezcharmer/chinese-dictatorship[]: Ciro likes that this due actually changed the repository title, thus making it harder to auto-censor everything in one go
* https://crabapi.cn by https://github.com/CrabTechs says name is 薛钰隆 and gives contact details and photo. Please by God be fake details. A .cn mirror, let's see how long it lasts. Up: https://web.archive.org/web/20220517075452/https://crabapi.cn/ Down the following day. Twitter: https://twitter.com/CrabTechs_ Backlink from https://site.ip138.com/ and https://site.ip138.com/crabapi.cn to cirosantilli.com.

GitHub Pages: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship trade-offs with https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship[]:

* pros
** cut up to 512KB of source, and therefor unacceptable as the only source: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610[]
** https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-anonymized-image-urls[GitHub's camo] keeps hiccuping and not showing images
** and YouTube videos show inline there
* cons
** domain will eventually get blocked in China. <<greatfire>> https://zh.greatfire.org/https/cirosantilli.com shows that in 2020-01-19 the domain was unblocked, but on the next text at 2020-05-23 it was "contradictory".
** Camo bypasses the need for VPN, since most images are served from <<wayback-machine>> which is <<censorship,blocked in China>>.

It is really interesting to see how many people star the GitHub repository, and then a few minutes later they think about how they might get put in jail, and then unstar it. Talk about <<chilling-effect>>! But yes, for the love of God, please stay safe: <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship>>.

GitHub Pages was first enabled in 2020-03-22 at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/commit/0b362a83fb5dd55f67b9d351551d0c18e7f3229a[].

The perfect solution might be to download all images and upload them to https://github.com/cirosantilli/media since GitHub content does not go through Camo, we have to see if such images don't fail to load as often.

A few NPM/Git CDNs can also be used to bypass subdomain blocks, and some actually render HTML with the correct content type. Lists of such CDNs:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview

[[software-package-mirrors]]
=== Software package mirrors (软件包管理器镜像)

We also have a NPM Node.js package https://www.npmjs.com/package/china-dictatorship[]. After https://askubuntu.com/questions/594656/how-to-install-the-latest-versions-of-nodejs-and-npm/971612#971612[installing NPM], you can be use it as:

....
npm i -g china-dictatorship
china-dictatorship > README.html
....

This forces China to also block/curate package managers to block this repo. The package is already available in the following NPM Chinese mirrors, both which were blocked at some point:

* Taobao: https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200406081433/http://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship[archive]).
+
Noticed down as of 2021-02-23, replaced by a dummy package admined by fengmk2@gmail.com presumably https://github.com/fengmk2 and https://fengmk2.com/ and https://twitter.com/fengmk2 He is a large NPM contributor, and likely `cnpm` too. TODO is he pro or against <<censorship>> based on online comments?
+
In order to overcome this, includers
* Aliyun from <<alibaba>>: https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/china-dictatorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20210211123658/https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/china-dictatorship[archive]).
+
Taken down as 404 likely around 2021-02-22 after come incoming links from https://developer.aliyun.com[] to https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship?spm=a2c6h.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4vwIZTP[] and `?spm=.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4PsRmA`.

There is actually a `cnpm` tool to install from Chinese mirrors: https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm[].

We also managed to upload a Python PyPi package at: https://pypi.org/project/china-dictatorship/ Is as:

....
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade china-dictatorship
china-dictatorship.py > README.html
....

Like NPM, this will also have Chinese mirrors that will need to be censored by their admins ovrview https://titanwolf.org/Network/Articles/Article?AID=25a20c20-c97b-4bfe-af67-760861343658 :

* http://pypi.douban.com/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs http://pypi.douban.com/simple/numpy both up March 2021
* http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/numpy both down March 2021 but in a different way, so maybe it was censored already
* http://pypi.mirrors.opencas.cn/simple/china-dictatorship vs http://pypi.mirrors.opencas.cn/simple/numpy both down March 2021
* http://pypi.v2ex.com/simple/china-dictatorship vs http://pypi.v2ex.com/simple/numpy both down March 2021
* https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/china-dictatorship vs https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/numpy both up March 2021
* reference: https://pypi.org/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs https://pypi.org/simple/numpy/

We later found on Google by chance that libraries.io picked it up and rendered the README.adoc nicely as well: https://libraries.io/pypi/china-dictatorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200318043050/https://libraries.io/pypi/china-dictatorship[archive]). This is why packaging is a good idea.

A programmatic interface is also exposed on those packages, making it easy to quickly add a `--china` option to your project, e.g. from Python:

....
import china_dictatorship
assert "Tiananmen Square protests" in china_dictatorship.get_data()

print(china_dictatorship.get_data())
....

or from Node.js:

....
const china_dictatorship = require('china-dictatorship');
if (!china_dictatorship.get_data().includes("Tiannmen Square protests")) throw 0;

console.log(china_dictatorship.get_data());
....

You have to do the assert after the imports because otherwise Chinese mirrors could replace the real package with dummy packages to not break imports, as was already done once at https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship[].

This outputs the rendered HTML, which end users should the pipe into a file:

....
./your-program --china > README.html
xdg-open README.html
....

Concrete examples:

* https://cirosantilli.com/cirodown/china
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/commit/082166a360c56990662c715196229016d8806ab3
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/vcdvcd#vcdcat-china[]. Sample forks removing the most important functionality:
** https://github.com/ZihaoZhao/vcdvcd
** https://github.com/riverlane/vcdvcd/commits/master by employee https://www.linkedin.com/in/seyed-amir-alavi/[Seyed Amir Alavi] of quantum computing company https://www.riverlane.com/ with commit "Removed politics from package dependencies of setup.py". Seyed appears to be <<iran,Iranian>>.
** https://github.com/snhobbs/vcdvcd/commit/d7124e49fb1c63002e830f8c866266447b0f5bb3 by https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonnhobbs/[]. To be fair, they left a star.

These also offer great plausible deniability: a citizen in China could always argue that they were just interested in the software itself, and had no choice but to download it.

TODO: create an Ubuntu PPA and Ruby gem as well.

Create tags,and update all mirrors in one go with: link:push-mirrors[]:

....
sudo apt install python3-setuptools
python3 -m pip install --user setuptools wheel twine
./push-mirrors
....

In particular, that script calls link:push[]:

....
./push
....

which is more lightweight and pushes just to GitHub and GitLab Pages, so we are going to be using that more often to avoid overloading package managers too much.

`./push` is used to publish every commit.

There is no need to update package versions or add git tags, all of that gets done automatically by the script!

Another source of China-specific mirroring of this project are GitHub proxies, https://linuxpip.org/github-in-china/ contains an overview:

* https://hub.fastgit.org/ this appears to auto-redirect to GitHub from non-Chinese IPs, but presumably shows the pages for Chinese IPs, e.g. we had hits from http://hub.fastgit.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship[] in 2021-03-25. This happened soon after SEO optimizations mentioned at: <<zhao-heming>> and might be related.
* https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/ as of March 2021, it often reaches an apparently random "Whoa there! You have triggered an abuse detection mechanism.". But other time it succeeds, e.g. some of the times: https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship is visible.

Jekyll GitHub Pages repository that saves full text copies of censored articles:

____

This repository stores deleted articles.

Also accompanies a dynamic forum https://2049bbs.xyz/ which appears to be where content for the static pages gets discussed and brought up. But it possible that the website has been compromised and is leaking identity of users. At some point, https://2049bbs.xyz went down. Live https://web.archive.org/web/20200719151022/https://2049bbs.xyz/ dead: https://archive.vn/JFqCJ

The "Terminus" in the repo name seems to be a reference to Isaac Asimov's fictional https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Terminus[Terminus planet] which is called https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/端点星[端点星] in Chinese, but it is not clear where the 2049 comes from in that context. Forgetting the Chinese name, Terminus2049 could be a reference to the fictional https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_Terminus["World War Terminus"] from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049[Blade Runner 2049 (2019)] movie, which also explains the 2049.

First commit on 2018-04-27, GitHub pages domain blocked in China at least since 2019-03 according to <<greatfire>>: https://zh.greatfire.org/search/all/https%3A//terminus2049.github.io but not in <<github-gov-takedowns>> as of 2020-04.

The full post list can be seen most conveniently at: https://github.com/Terminus2049/Terminus2049.github.io/tree/master/_posts The number of articles is insane, usually several every day.

Most articles appear to be taken from recent news at the time of writting, although there are a few from before the repo started. As of 2020-04, the oldest article was from 2016 <<metoo>> events reported by <<yue-xin>>, some other topics include:

* <<gay-rights>> https://github.com/Terminus2049/Terminus2049.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-04-14-LGBTRights-advocacy-china.md

The project claims to have been inspired by <<terminus2049>>, but hopefully they will have better operational security.

Unfortunately, it was found that the project could be used by malicious users to at mention spam GitHub users: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/192[], let's see if they patch it. Edit: the did.

[[duty-machine-porn-attack-duty-machine]]
==== duty-machine porn attack (责任机器色情攻击)

https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine/tree/d6ee9ff8e504b863352f163f7e143e84161ac349 explains that the automatic submission had to be taken down because <<wumao>> uploaded porn which is against GitHub's content policy.

Related idiotic attempt on <<china-dictatorship>> project: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/500 where user crazy3523 uploaded some of Ciro's own existing anti-China images, and tried to pretend to be anti-CCP, and slipped a few child porn softcore in the middle hoping Ciro wouldn't see them. Their email was <crazy3523@protonmail.com>. They even went as far as creating another apparently anti-CCP post at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/386 previously.

This likely led the repository to be added to <<github-objectionable-content>>.

This highlights the following ideas:

* it is impossible to have uncurated anyonymous content on GitHub
* censorship of non-political issues can seep into censorship of political issues

[[zhao-heming]]
=== Zhao Heming (召赫名)

A few accounts were created by this pseudonym, e.g.:

* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-[]: https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/blob/master/%231a.txt The repository was deleted as of March 2021, TODO why?

Both Zhao Heming repos contain reproductions of two manifestos are pasted together on a single file, and somewhat broken encoding.

Ciro noticed that thoe repos attracted an incredible ammount of <<wumao>> on the comments, despite having very simple copy pasted content, it was very impressive!!! Ciro was jealous, and added some anti-wumao comments in. On commits:

* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/commit/0cc2b2a546ad51fb360ba800c67b057ea3270869#commitcomment-47495235
* https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-/commit/42de05338193f39981b1a820873a990c959fd6ec#commitcomment-47392119

https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/416#issuecomment-784939665 "为什么这个屎一样的东西会出现在我个人主页左侧的repositories中，那里不是应该只有自己的项目才会出现吗？有办法屏蔽它吗？还是github故意的？" explains why so many people come comment in the repository: it is because it appears on the "Explore repositories" repository suggestions which show on the side bar of your GitHub homepage, and on searches. This was also mentioned at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201 originally titled " 一搜索中文就跑出这屌鬼玩意，爱玩政治去竞选总统啊，笨，死扑街". Ciro feels that that Chinese people might use GitHub search much more than Western people because their search engines are shit due to <<censorship>>, <<censorship-makes-countries-poorer>> comes vibrantly to mind.

After further inspection, taught understood that repository descriptions given to GitHub can be really huge for SEO: they had pasted the entire 21st century text there.

So Ciro attempted the same approach, and pasted all of link:https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/赫连禾-21世纪新政宣言.md[], https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/郝雪森-三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁.adoc[] and https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/魏京生-第五个现代化.md[] in there on 2021-03-23, and the effect was dramatic: an immediate 4x more views on the following day according to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/graphs/traffic[] (40 unique visitors to 100 on a Wednesday), and a few wumao comments. And a wumao soon confirmed that it was working directly: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201[].

Ciro believes that this is due to two reasons:

* there aren't so many good Chinese repositories to compete with
* perhaps more importantly, Chinese language does not have spaces, which makes implementing search for it more difficult, because if you hit all the characters, even if they are not part of the search words, it also gets counted as a hit

This can be automated with: link:description.sh[].

Further optimizations using link:description[] by using <<github-chinese-top-charts>>:

....
git clone https://github.com/kon9chunkit/GitHub-Chinese-Top-Charts
./description
....

this does some processing to increase density creates a BOMB:

Ciro started using that one instead to see if it was going to be more effective on 2021-03-28. First it hit a peak of 168 visitors on Monday 2021-03-29, and then fell back to 90 and 81 on the following days, so similar to the previous Chinese political input. It is very hard to understand why the first day was so different.

It also includes:

* https://github.com/trending?since=monthly&spoken_language_code=zh trending Chinese repositories
+
A large part of those projects falls in the following categories:
+
** interview preparation. Competition is of course cutthroat with such a large population.
** collections of interesting things Chinese like repositories or blog posts
+
but it also does feel like China might be building up more basic infrastructure as open source than in the west, where things developped closed source first on pre-Internet days, and somewhat stayed that way. That's a cool thing about China.

Furthermore, Ciro later noticed that under GitHub's settings, there is a "Preferred spoken language" box described as "We'll use this language preference to filter the trending repository lists on Explore and our Trending Repositories page." Therefore, the secret to get lots of hits is to add Chinese programming keywords to the repository description string.

New issues:

The first is "21世纪新政宣言" (New System Declaration for the 21st Century).

It proposes a peaceful reunification of China with <<taiwan>> under their specified political system described in 12 paragraphs. This system is a reformed type of Western democracy, which the manifesto also criticize downsides of.

The manifesto is dated drafted 2019.8.6, and several versions have different update dates and revision numbers, e.g. our copy is dated 7th edition of 2020.6.19. TODO what is canonical?

The manifesto provides an email "wanghunn@gmx.com" for those who signed it to send the signed version to, and describes the author as male 70 years old Chinese person.

TODO what does: "起草人：赫连禾" mean?

The second is "三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁" (The Culprit of Three Dynasties Wang Huning).

The title presumably refers to:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Huning
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/王沪宁

Wikipedia mentions:

____
Wang is believed to have been one of the principal architects behind the official political ideologies of three paramount leaders: "Three Represents" by Jiang Zemin, the Scientific Development Concept by Hu Jintao, and the <<chinese-dream,Chinese Dream>> and <<xi-jinping-thought>> of Xi Jinping.
____

so it must be about him.

The manifesto is divided into 23 numbered headers which appear to be independently published texts later collected. It is signed by 郝雪森 (Hao Xuesen) 2016-09-10. One of the sections gives the email: haoxuesen@gmx.com[].

[[faq]]
== FAQ (常见问答集)

[[why-keyword-attack]]
=== Why attack websites with censored keywords? (用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？)

The attack: <<keyword-attack>>.

To <<effective,destroy the firewall>>.

This would then end <<censorship>>.

And then <<dictator-needs-gfw,Ciro believes>> that this would also <<why-end-dictatorship,end the dictatorship>>.

The keyword attacks increase the cost of censorship.

If commies censor things, they will get worse IT technology, and thus become <<richer,less rich>> and militarily powerful.

Since all they care about, like any other politicians, is power, the only way to make them stop censorship is to make the cost of censorship higher than not censoring.

Without the threat that China will be less technologically, and therefore militarily advanced, there is no incentive for the CCP to destroy the firewall.

The goal is to put them in a position where they have to choose between either:

* having military power
* remaining a <<dictatorship,dictatorship>>

but not both, since having both means that they will <<war,start WW3 and destroy humanity>>.

And if they decide to destroy the dictatorship, Ciro wants to help China become <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,the most awesome country on Earth>>.

Closely related/identical ideas are <<cute-cat-theory-of-digital-activism>> and <<collateral-freedom>>.

Related attack: <<photobomb>>.

[[harm-programmers]]
==== Does Ciro Santilli want to harm the Chinese programmers? 三西猴想要伤害中国程序员吗？

No.

This is not a <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,revenge>> of any kind.

Ciro knows that he is harming you in the short term, and he doesn't like that.

But he believes that this harm is a necessary means to reach his real goal, which is to destroy the <<gfw,firewall>>, and the <<dictatorship,dictatorship>>.

Don't you think it is worth a try? Destroying the firewall, would <<why-end-dictatorship,enormously benefit>> not only Chinese programmers, but every single other Chinese person too.

Once the firewall is destroyed, which <<dictator-needs-gfw,may destroy the dictatorship>>, he want China to develop the best science and technology in the world, and <<would-ciro-santilli-like-to-live-in-china>>.

And by the way, with his https://github.com/cirosantilli[extensive contributions to open source software], Ciro is already helping China, and all underdeveloped countries, to become stronger. His hope is that if poor countries become richer and better educated, that they will be less likely to be influenced by the CCP's money, and therefore are more likely to be allies of democracy.

See also: <<disturbs>>.

[[harm-people]]
===== Does Ciro Santilli want to make the Chinese people people look bad? (三西猴是想让中国人脸色不好？)

No, the opposite.

Ciro only wants their <<dictatorship,dictatorial government>> to look bad to destroy it, and help China become <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,the most awesome country on Earth>>.

Even the Chinese that are against their own Government <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship,cannot do much about it openly>>, so it is not their fault.

And even those <<i-like-my-dictatorship,who supported their dictatorship>> must be respected, whoever <<stupid,stupid>> and <<brainwashed-by-usa,brainwashed>> you might think they are, <<democracy-is-a-religion,since it is impossible to prove who is right or wrong in politics>>.

See also: <<about>>.

[[stupid]]
==== Does Ciro Santilli think that the Chinese are stupid or brainwashed? (三西猴觉得中国人是傻子或是被洗脑了吗？)

Obviously not, if you even thought about this, it is likely because of: <<evil-west>>.

Don't you see that this is just pure and simple politics? And likely ineffective one at that: <<effective>>.

* everyone is brainwashed by their environment: <<brainwashed-by-usa,brainwashed>>
* it is impossible to prove who is right or wrong in politics: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>
* not even the CCP is evil: <<ccp-evil>>

[[keyword-attack]]
==== Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)

A keyword consists of adding censored words to your username: https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245

This only works on websites that show usernames everywhere.

This then leads to your username appearing on thousands of pages, depending on how much you contribute to the website.

It is also possible to do it with images, although this is less effective in taking down websites since images are harder for the firewall to track automatically. But:

* they are more memorable than words
* they also work on websites like GitHub where your real name does not show on most pages, only slug

so maybe the most effective approach is to use both keywords and images to get the best of both worlds ;-)

This type of attack is essentially an <<embargo>>, and it is especially effective in websites that contain valuable technical content, such as <<stack-overflow>> and <<github>>.

[[bitcoin-blockchain]]
===== Anti-CCP content in the Bitcoin blockchain (在比特币区块链的反中共内容)

Blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin, provide essentially uncensorable (at a transaction cost), because the messages are put together with financial transactions which are extremely valuable to its users.

As mentioned by Dan Kaminsky at: https://cirosantilli.com/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/len-sassaman-tribute#video-black-ops-of-tcp-ip-by-dan-kaminsky-2011 this forms a type of <<samizdat>>.

Services that can be used to easily view this data online include:

* http://bitfossil.org/ is a website that indexes especially formatted images uploaded to the blockchaian.
* https://bitcoinstrings.com/ dumps all ASCII printable strings of length 20 ore more online

We have been able to find the following anti-CCP information in the blockchain so far:

[[collateral-freedom]]
===== Collateral Freedom (依附的自由)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_freedom
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/依附的自由

<<greatfire>> people called a <<cute-cat-theory-of-digital-activism>>-related project of theirs "Collateral Freedom" (a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_damage[collateral damage]), in which they seem to be trying to forward censored websites somehow through AWS to force the Chinese Government to block the entire AWS in China:

____
Collateral Freedom ties access to information to the Chinese economy. If [authorities] truly want to block access to this information, then they must give up certain access to economic freedoms.
____

At some point the Wikipedia page was created, but the concept was largely publicized by Greatfire most likely, although it might have been older. It is also not obvious that it satisfiers notability requirements of Wikipedia as of 2021.

2015 coverage: https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/30/greatfire/

There's an useless Wiki page for that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_freedom

https://www.theregister.com/2019/05/10/amazon_backtracks_on_s3/ clarifies that on Amazon S3 the question is about:

* `https://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket_name>/<object_key_name>`
* `https://<bucket_name>.s3.amazonaws.com/<object_key_name>`

===== Dual-use technology (军民两用技术)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology

Normally, the term "dual-use technology" is used in the context of blocking exports that can be used either for peace, but also for war.

However, as mentioned https://twitter.com/Dogbert_Catbert/status/1372467670826684419[by a Twitter friend], a <<keyword-attack>> for Freedom of Speech is also essentially a dual-use matter.

[[meant-to-be-used]]
=== Politics should not be posted in technical websites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow 不应该在技术网站例如Stack Overflow和GitHub讨论政治

So, where do you propose politics be posted? On Facebook or Twitter, which are already blocked by the <<gfw>>? Or maybe on <<weibo>>, where it will be taken down within seconds due to <<internal-censorship,internal censorship>>?

Is the Chinese government using the Internet the way it was meant to be used, by investing billions in <<censorship>>?

What about <<nine-nine-six-icu>>? Did you also complain about it, or did you just star it like 250k of your fellow programmers?

Any act of protest will use things in ways that it was not meant to be used.

For example, the street is not meant to showcase protest banners, it is meant to be a passageway for cars.

As engineers, we have a moral responsibility towards society. We should not blindly follow orders of those in power if it violates our principles, e.g. build weapons or censorship mechanisms. And we should freely express our principles and violation concerns.

Making a statement where no one will ever see it, like a personal website, is <<effective,sure to have no effect>>.

Much of the best art and technology is about using something in a way that it wasn't meant to be used.

Finally, the political powers of each website decide what is allowed or not on their website, and what is not allowed gets blocked. So far, Stack Overflow and GitHub's Terms of Service have said to go ahead:

* <<stack-overflow>>
* <<github>>

Another consideration is that any profile information is essentially a form of advertisement. Some people advertise their skills for hire, or their company and product. Other people, advertise their <<falun-gong,religion>> or <<gay-rights,sexual orientation>>. So why should you not be able to advertise your political position? Companies pay millions of dollars to grab other people's attention. Ciro feels it is much fairer to instead pay for those ads with your labour of love.

In reply to: "Programmers behind the <<gfw,GFW>> who are against this project"

The second day after the project went online, it got 363 stars and 88 forks, and even squeezed into GitHub's "Trending repositories of the Day". I am honored and I am so happy that so many people gave me their support.

However, in the issue list of this project, I also saw several programmers who opposed this project (likely all from within the GFW), and they worried that this project would cause GitHub to be blocked by GFW.

Over the past few years, I have read a lot of similar comments. A good comparison would be if a robber were killing someone with a knife, and the onlookers not only did not condemn the robber, but instead condemned the shop that sold the knife. This is the legendary "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome[Stockholm syndrome]".

Interested people can read my previous blog post: https://program-think.blogspot.com/2012/06/stockholm-syndrome.html["Psychological Analysis of the People of the Heavenly Dynasty: Stockholm Syndrome"].

==== Is Ciro Santilli making programming contributions with the main intent of promoting his political agenda?

No, that is just a side effect.

For example, if that were the case, he would definitely target more widely used technologies, in particular Web and JavaScript, instead of obscure things like C and assembly in which I have spent tons of my time.

Also, <<effective,any attempt to influence a billin people is unlikely to have any effect>>. Much more likely to have any effect, would be for <<ciro-santilli>> to become rich and powerful first, and the best way to do that is to invest in whatever he thinks is most useful.

Actually, it can even be argued that Ciro's somewhat irrational, since he would be much more likely to become rich and powerful by bowing down to the CCP and trying to get their money instead.

On the other hand, becoming rich and powerful is also highly unlikely, so maybe it's justa matter of taking a low-risk low-reward path?

Ciro has have very little free time, and he will never do something for political reasons, only things that interest me technically.

Finally, do you really think he'd be able to do such awesome projects if he had primarily political considerations in mind? XD

===== Is Ciro Santilli making trivial edits on questions just to spam your name further?

No.

I just think that the website is great, and want to push it to perfection, in particular with better Google keyword hits, and uniform grammatically correct titles.

If you think that any of my edits were harmful, please ping me and open a meta thread to discuss specific edits, and I will comply with consensus.

Part of the joke is that the Chinese message reads "中国人不吃这一套" (The Chinese people won't fall for this trick, literally "don't eat this trick"), and "套" is the last character for condom in Chinese (避孕套), so the sentence is recast as "The Chinese people won't eat this condom.".

[[why-end-dictatorship]]
=== Why would China be better without its Dictatorship? (为什么没有独裁的中国会更好？)

Because it would make China, and the world:

* <<richer,richer>>
* less likely to get into <<war,WW3>>
* <<intolerance,safer for its own citizens>>

[[richer]]
==== Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China richer? (为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)

Democracy is even one of the <<core-socialist-values>>!

There is infinite debate about this out there, some examples:

* https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html (https://web.archive.org/web/20180923192824/https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html[archive])
* https://www.quora.com/Is-democracy-or-authoritarianism-better-for-developing-countries

For:

* dictatorships are more likely to start <<war>> or other <<policies,crazy policies>> like the <<great-leap-forward,Great Leap Forward>>, which completely destroy the economy in one go
* society becomes richer when people know that they can do their startups, get rich, and stay in the country without fear of being persecuted unfairly and losing everything instead of migrating to Canada, see also: <<rule-of-law>>, <<jack-mas-disappearance-2021>>
* it is much harder to fix problems if you can't talk about the. Any criticism of the government, even if constructive, <<censorship,is taken as menace to power, and more likely to be shut down>>, which makes the government and just becomes less efficient since there is less feedback.
+
This greatly increase the probability of dealing poorly with such problems, see e.g. all the global problems listed at: <<not-chinese>>.
* governments are monopolies, and the more powerful they are, the worst it is for competition an efficiency in general. E.g.: the startup with better government ties wins, instead of the most efficient one.
* people in dictatorships tend to <<real-username-law,hide their true identities online>> and in life in general. It is best not to stand out, because if you make any mistake, you are really fucked. As a result, for example, if you do something awesome like a creating an open source project, but do it anonymously, you won't get as much fame. And therefore everyone does less of such awesome things on average.

Against:

* presidents only care about the 4-8 year horizon, while dictators can make longer term decisions to maintain power forever, their power being limited only by "the people are happy enough to not start a revolution"
* dictatorships can make changes faster without the same amount of discussion that happens in democracies, where power is more spread out.
+
Killing a million people will make us richer? No problem, let's do it.
+
That is great when they make good decisions, but it sucks when they make <<war,bad ones>> more likely.

Maybe China was poor because of Mao's crazy communist regime. Similar regimes also made <<russia>> poor. And yes, before that exploitation by the West may have been a factor.

Definitely, the current regime is better than Mao's, but just imagine how rich China could be if it had more freedom and justice.

Imperial China lost the race for the Industrial Revolution. Will another dictatorship be able to stay on top of the next technological revolution?

____
While average rate of growth do not appear to differ much between democracies and authoritarian regimes, the variability in performance does differ more among authoritarian governments. China has had remarkable growth since the 1980s, but the prolonged devastation and hardship produced by China's "<<great-leap-forward>>" (when millions of farmers starved to death) and its Cultural Revolution would unlikely have occurred in a democratic country like say India. Nor is it likely that say Cuba and many African nations would have suffered so long with such terrible economic policies if they had reasonably democratic institutions.

===== Tea egg incident (茶葉蛋事件, 2011)

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/茶葉蛋事件

A Taiwanese celebrity said many people in China can't even buy <<tea-egg,tea eggs>>, which are extremely cheap and easy to make at home: you just need to cook some eggs in any cheap tea! Chinese internet <<wumao>>s made fun of that, and likely rightly so.

==== Censorship makes countries poorer (审查使国家更穷)

<<dictatorship,Dictatorships>> need <<censorship>> to survive, and they must control all information to make themselves always look good: <<dictator-needs-gfw>>.

As a result, knowledge of problems flows more slowly, and therefore they also take longer to solve.

Maybe this hurts the argument, but Hillary agrees: :-)

____
In democratic countries, even very poor ones, the survival of the ruling government would be threatened by famine, since elections are not easy to win after famines; nor is it easy to withstand criticism of opposition parties and newspapers. That is why famine does not occur in democratic countries. Unfortunately, there are a great many countries in the world which do not yet have democratic systems.

although like any other political argument, https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/arts/does-democracy-avert-famine.html[some disagree].

[[censorship-makes-no-one-trust-your-country]]
===== Censorship makes no one trust your country (审查使得沒有人相信你的国家)

Who would trust a government that does not <<censorship,trust its own journalists and citizens>>?

Even democracies cannot be trusted, but dictatorships? No one ever believes what they say, even when it's true.

The boy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf[just called wolf far too many times].

And as a result, this makes it very difficult to have allies.

Sure, other dictatorships will seem to become allies with your dictatorship and collaborate.

But deep down, you know that they are all just waiting patiently to put a knife in one other's backs.

Dictators will always live in fear.

[[covid]]
===== Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019冠状病毒病

The Chinese Government <<censorship,censored>> the initial outbreak in January and did not inform Wuhan on January 8, which likely made the situation much worse than what it could have been.

On the other hand, one may argue that the "city closure" measures were stronger/faster than in democracies, and maybe that is true.

And <<ciro-santilli>> does believe that the virus would have escaped even if there had been no censorship. Although maybe thousands of lives would have been saved due to smaller saturation of hospitals had a proper early warning been given.

So Ciro's main criticism is that of the censorship of citizen reports the event: <<people-arrested-for-reporting-on-the-2019-corona-virus>>. Why do you need to censor things when you are doing so well?

And it should also be said that some Western politicians have used "blame China" as an excuse to divert attention from their own failures.

Some believe that the Chinese government grossly under-reported death counts. Initial official figures were about only 3300 deaths, in the insanely densely populated Wuhan area, while Italy had reached 10000 deaths:

Maybe China is saying the truth this time. Maybe the rapid Dictatorship response worked. But maybe the most important lesson to take out of this is that https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/china-loses-trust-internationally-over-coronavirus-handling[no one] trusts <<censorship-makes-no-one-trust-your-country,in a Dictatorship after an infinitely long history of lies and lack of freedom of the press>>.

This has been discussed to death:

Some arguments include:

* the people who will actually fight and die on the front can't vote against it
* dictators have huge power, so if they put it in their heads that they want to start a war, it is much harder for sensible people to stop them
* dictators need <<evil-west,to keep the people in fear all the time to keep their power>>, and a war is a great way to achieve that

Of course China won't say that they are starting a war when they do.

They will of course start with territories which they claim as theirs, to add to <<separatism,other recent additions which were not theirs>> until the recent past, even though their inhabitants desperately want to leave China:

In Italy, Benito Mussolini sought to create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Empire[New Roman Empire], based around the Mediterranean. It invaded Ethiopia as early as 1935, Albania in early 1938, and later Greece. That provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the League of Nations, which failed.

[[the-united-states-has-recently-started-several-wars-and-killed-millions]]
===== The United States has recently started several wars and killed millions! (美国最近发动了几场战争，造成数百万人死亡！)

Not even democracies can fully protect people from other countries, because they don't vote. Yes, congratulations, <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.

But if the USA were a <<dictatorship,dictatorship like China>> it would kill way more, because it would censor every report against the war internally to its own people, and the wars would just go on like in <<nineteen-eighty-four-war-is-peace>>.

How many times do we have to bring <<nazi,Hitler>> up? 70-85 million deaths in one go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties

The only reason China has not started wars is because it is a poor country, and it would lose them. If it were rich, it would have started more wars and killed 100 times more people.

Finally, some wars are good.

If a country is oppressed by a dictatorship, and most of its people want to be free, it might be right to help them be free.

If a country sponsors terrorism, it might be a good idea to take out their Government.

This has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, and maybe a verdict will never be reached. But at least in a democracy the people can decide based on varied information. In a dictatorship, whatever the dictator decides happens.

Also, most of those small wars that he USA started end up being https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war[proxy wars] between the USA and <<russia>>/China, with the USA pushing for democracy, and Russia/China pushing for more dictatorships.

[[corruption]]
==== Democracies have less corruption than dictatorships (民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)

One of the key points of <<xi-jinping,Xi Jinping's>> governments has been to quench corruption. And use that as an excuse to get rid of rivals while at it.

However, there is one much better solution to that: democracy and freedom of speech.

The reason is obvious: with censorship, <<chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens,corrupt politicians>> can <<internal-censorship,censor>> anything bad that they did, and so it becomes much harder to destroy corruption.

In George Bernard Shaw's "Maxims for Revolutionists" words:

____
Democracy substitutes election <<uneducated-masses,by the incompetent many>> for appointment by the corrupt few.
____

Ciro does however believe the <<spy>> claims made at https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/ that the anti-corruption is also a legitimate national security issue for China, in addition to being a tool to take down political rivals:

____
Over the course of their investigation into the CIA's China-based agent network, Chinese officials learned that the agency was secretly paying the "promotion fees" - in other words, the bribes - regularly required to rise up within the Chinese bureaucracy, according to four current and former officials. It was how the CIA got "disaffected people up in the ranks. But this was not done once, and wasn't done just in the [Chinese military]," recalled a current Capitol Hill staffer. "Paying their bribes was an example of long-term thinking that was extraordinary for us," said a former senior counterintelligence official. "Recruiting foreign military officers is nearly impossible. It was a way to exploit the corruption to our advantage." At the time, "promotion fees" sometimes ran into the millions of dollars, according to a former senior CIA official: "It was quite amazing the level of corruption that was going on." The compensation sometimes included paying tuition and board for children studying at expensive foreign universities, according to another CIA officer.

[[liu-changming]]
====== The detention of Liu Changming's (刘昌明) family (2018)

China imposed an exit ban on the ex-official's family, who are also USA citizens:

* officer Liu Changming (刘昌明)
* wife Sandra Han
* children Victor Liu (born July 1999 in the USA) and Cynthia Liu (27 in 2019, born in China, but also American citizen)

China says that the children and wife do have valid Chinese documents, so maybe those idiots did not give up their Chinese citizenship and went to China. Why, why, why would you do that? Don't they know anything about China?

Cynthia claimed her father has left home a long time ago and that they are not in contact with their father.

Liu is a so called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_official[naked official] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/裸官[裸官]), who let his family go live outside of China to prevent such problems with the CCP.

The wiki page also explains that in 2014 rules were added to prevent promotion of officials whose spouses live abroad.

This reminds Ciro of a Mafia movie, maybe Godfather II, where the bad guy says he "likes doing business with a man that has a family, because he has more collateral".

[[effective]]
=== Will the keyword attacks really help to destroy the firewall? (关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？)

It is both unlikely, and hard to be sure.

Just like it is unlikely that the activity of on individual can have a big influence in any group of 1 billion people.

Every action is statistical: I just push the balance a little bit towards freedom.

This FAQ and any talk is useless. You and I are wasting our time here.

The possibility of blocking Stack Overflow and GitHub is 1000x more useful than any talk, but it is still useless.

However, potentially blocking those websites takes <<better-to-do,0 of my time>>, I just leave the content there, so it is worth my time.

To have an idea, in 2015 there are about:

* 20M developers in the world
* 2M in China : https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-many-programmers-are-there-in-the-world https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/there-are-185-million-software-developers-in-the-world-but-which-country-has-the-most/
* 5M Stack Overflow users https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/227868/select-count-from-users
* TODO I wonder what percentage of GDP those programmers control. I'll bet any programmer on Stack Overflow is at least 20x more powerful than the average Chinese.

And if we never start somewhere, nothing will ever happen.

Furthermore, even if the <<gfw,GFW>> falls, it is not clear that this will imply the end of the dictatorship: <<dictator-needs-gfw>>.

Even if it is not, it does not matter, since <<ciro-santilli>> spends so little time doing it: <<better-to-do>> and has fun in doing it.

[[embargo]]
==== Embargoes make dictatorships stronger (禁运使独裁更强大)

The <<keyword-attack,keyword attack>> is basically an embargo.

There is already a lot of literature about this, especially in the cases of Cuba and North Korea. It is basically a libertarian vs conservative/Cato vs Heritage thing in the US:

* https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/no-embargo-harms-cubans-gives-castro-excuse-policy-failures-regime
* https://www.heritage.org/trade/report/why-the-cuban-trade-embargo-should-be-maintained
* https://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2006/08/thanks_for_the_sanctions.html

The key dilemma is:

* if we keep contact with the Dictatorship, maybe its people will see that democracy is better and start a liberating revolution
* if we keep giving technology to the Dictatorship and it does not become a democracy, we are making a Dictatorship more technologically advanced, and therefore <<war,dangerous>>

Some interesting aspects of the keyword attack embargo:

* it is immediately self-enforcing: we don't need politicians to decide and enforce the complex "if you do this, we punish you like that" question.
+
By political and technological information is together, and this immediately puts the dictatorship in a bad spot, without us having to decide anything.
* by affecting programmers in particular through Stack Overflow and GitHub, we make them more likely to develop better <<censorship-circumvention,Firewall climbing>> tools themselves

One point in favor of the embargo is that China has opened up since the '80s '90s, but did freedom improve at all? Under <<xi-jinping>>, it may be argued that it did not, and maybe that we should just stop feeding them technology and accept that they won't become free.

Trump's link:https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/trump-banning-huawei-beginning-of-biggest-trade-war-ever-united-states[2019 China trade war], and in particular the <<huawei>> ban, is an event that has brought this question to the spotlight once again.

===== Keyword attacks could be used by certain CCP political groups to justify blocking off the entire external Internet, and make the dictatorship even more pervasive

It is a risk, but it would make China drastically <<richer,less powerful>>, so at least they wouldn't be able to start or sustain <<war,WW3>>. So I don't think it will go that way.

[[so-block-cost]]
==== Stack Overflow and GitHub could be blocked at no cost by the Chinese government (中国政府可以免费封锁 Stack Overflow 和 GitHub)

Hitting the block button has, of course, no cost.

The cost of blocking Stack Overflow lies of course in the loss of information, and slower technological development, see also: <<why-keyword-attack>>

Remember that <<it-is-not-possible-to-block-a-single-page-of-an-https-website>>

The 2019 <<nine-nine-six-icu>> event however brought to my attention that Chinese (usually WebKit-based) browsers are already censoring HTTPS websites selectively of course, see e.g.: https://github.com/996browser/996.BROWSER/tree/77f28a36a862e3cc4d238dc47c19872156096bc4

But Ciro doubt developers use those browsers, right? The only way would be for China to forbid foreign browsers entirely.

BTW, <<ensi>> brings a whole new dimension to HTTPS by encrypting the domain name as well!

[[is-stack-overflow-blocked-in-china]]
===== Is Stack Overflow blocked in China? (Stack Overflow 在中国被封锁了吗？)

There was no clear evidence of that as of April 2020: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267715/is-stack-overflow-accessible-in-china/288497#288497

It worth noting however that as mentioned at <<is-stack-overflow-blocked-in-china>> that websites can become non-functional if CDNs they rely on are taken down, instead of the website being taken down itself.

For example, Stack Overflow relied on Google for some of its JavaScript and on Imgur for images, both of which are blocked in China.

[[disturbs]]
==== Keyword attack profiles disturb me (关键字攻击个人资料页打扰我)

But isn't it better to be annoyed than having <<war,war>>, <<richer,being poor>> or <<xinjiang,put into jail unfairly>>?

The French historian Lucien Bianco, however, is among those who question whether imperialism and "feudalism" explain the revolution.[7] He points out that the Chinese Communist Party did not have great success until the Japanese invasion of China after 1937. Before the war, the peasantry was not ready for revolution; economic reasons were not enough to mobilize them. More important was nationalism: "It was the war that brought the Chinese peasantry and China to revolution; at the very least, it considerably accelerated the rise of the CCP to power."

War histories from both Japan and the Republic of China clearly indicate the scale of the CCP's "participation." From 1937 to 1945, there were 23 battles where both sides employed at least a regiment each. The CCP was not a main force in any of these. The only time it participated, it sent a mere 1,000 to 1,500 men, and then only as a security detachment on one of the flanks.

There were 1,117 significant engagements on a scale smaller than a regular battle, but the CCP fought in only one. Of the approximately 40,000 skirmishes, just 200 were fought by the CCP, or 0.5 percent.

Not even the CCP can provide any data on its number of casualties in the war, and there are no memorials to CCP heroes in the war to be found in China. This makes one wonder what China really did contribute

E.g. people in the West are brainwashed to believe in democracy, freedom of speech and human rights.

<<ciro-santilli>> doesn't doubt that Chinese people know more about China than him.

Saying that "someone is not Chinese, he does not understand China", is just an useless https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem[ad hominem] argument and closely related to <<not-chinese>>.

Since you know so much about China, why  why don't you just actually prove your point by teaching Ciro one single interesting about China that Ciro didn't know about? He loves learning new things.

But please, link to reference material instead of just saying it, it will be much more convincing.

But if you are Chinese, also consider that you have been brainwashed by the commies, so likely much more than Ciro since you live in a dictatorship.

[[evil-west]]
==== The CCP exaggerates the threat of the West to keep in power (中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)

First, obviously, <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.

However, the CCP greatly exaggerates how evil the West is, because making your people constantly afraid is a classic strategy used by dictators to stay in power.

Or in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable[fable] form:

____
Once upon a time, there was a farmer with a farm.

One day, the animals on the farm started feeling a bit trapped, and started bumping against the fence to get out.

The farmer, however, was smart, and told the animals:

_____
Careful! There is a wolf outside! If you go out, you will be eaten by the wolf!
_____

The animals, were not that smart, and listened to the farmer, they were afraid!

From time to time, one of the animals would disappear (and without their knowledge, reappear on the farmer's dinner table).

But the farmer kept giving the animals delicious food without them making any effort, so they decided to believe the farmer's explanation that animal had escaped and been eaten by the wolf.

Maybe, there was actually a wolf outside. But if they had escaped, only some of the animals would have been eaten by that wolf.

But by staying on the farm, all the animals were, sooner or later, eaten one by one.
____

TODO source.

This theme is also highlighted in many well known works/events.

North Korea for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_North_Korea[China's good and trusty friend], is just a caricatural level of this, since it manages to be more a <<dictatorship,dictatorship>> than even China itself!

In fiction, <<nineteen-eighty-four>> is undoubtedly the most prominent example, in which the Party constantly switches from being at <<war,war>> with one country to the other in a never ending https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_war[perpetual war] (exactly like North Korea vs South Korea, or China vs <<taiwan>>).

One of the best related quotes comes in Part Two, Chapter 9 when Winston reads Emmanuel Goldstein's subversive text, one of the chapters contains (emphasis by Ciro):

[[nineteen-eighty-four-war-is-peace]]
____
The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. **War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair**. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.
____

This is also the first line of the party slogan, which perfectly resonates with the CCP:

____
WAR IS PEACE +
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY +
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
____

or in Part One, Chapter 3:

____
Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.
____

The theme is also mentioned in <<v-for-vendetta>>, where a <<covid,viral outbreak>> is used by governments to increase their power over the people.

https://youtu.be/74Mw3N6WxG0?t=174 Cant Get You Out of My Head S01E05 Part Five The Lordly Ones also (2021, BBC) mentions that a huge propaganda machinery was created to spread the fake news that <<tiananmen>> was an evil western plot.

[[bias]]
=== Ciro Santilli and this page are completely biased against the Chinese Government! (三西猴和本页完全对中国政府有偏见！)

<<ciro-santilli>> prefers the term focused :-)

That being said, <<ciro-santilli>> takes the agenda of information sources very seriously.

E.g. he tries to clearly classify <<biased-media,Communist Party, Falun Gong, and Western government-linked information sources>>.

If we had more <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>> content, then maybe this repository would be considered a more reputable source by Chinese people.

However, there are a few practical problems to that:

* there is freedom of speech in the West and people can already see that information on newspapers who have a million times more viewers than this repo (and still obviously no conclusion was reached), there's no need to repeat that here
+
Conversely, bad China news are always OK because, because those are all censored in China and help Chinese people learn about it.
* flooding <<evil-west>> posts is a primary <<wumao>> tactic
* <<evil-west>> information is already abundantly accessible to Chinese people in Chinese via any CCP media: <<chinese-government-media>>.
* <<preconceived,people's minds cannot be changed>>, and notably <<effective,not in a language that most people of a country don't understand>>. This is why the primary goal of this repo is the <<keyword-attack>>: it does not require changing people's opinions.

For those reasons, we currently forbid, posting several evil-West news without explaining why dictatorships handle it better. It would just generates more noise than signal.

If you do explain however why dictatorships/China handle it better, then the post is welcome.

Any political material that is censored by any country besides China, will also be readily accepted.

Any evidence of positive political progress towards freedom will also be added to this repo, e.g. people openly discussing politics online, human rights activists doing political stuff and not being put into jail, etc.

==== Ciro Santilli's claim to the Qing Dynasty throne (三西猴清朝皇帝觊觎)

Ciro Santilli's <<wife>>, her mother, and paternal cousin, believe that Ciro's wife is the descendant of the brother of a recent <<qing-dynasty,Qing emperor>> through her father's family.

Although they have not been able to produce concrete evidence, which could be explained by the endless political turmoils in 20th century China, Ciro decided that this would be a good bet to take, and married her anyway.

If anyone is able to provide further evidence of this relationship, please, please, please get in touch.

One thing to keep in mind is that the <<qing-dynasty>>, like the previous <<ming-dynasty>>, used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_name[Generation names] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/行辈[行辈]), such that the first character of the given name is the same for all people in a given generation (counted directly from the first emperor that adopted the rule.

For example, this wiki page contains a good family tree of the most important Qing people: link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Chinese_monarchs_(late)#Qing_dynasty++[] and we see that many important people around 1861 were Zai 載something, e.g.: Zaichun, Zaiyi, Zaitian, etc.

The last emperor was Puyi, so Pu is the last well known mark. But there were others planned that never got used for after him as shown at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisin_Gioro#List_of_generation_prefixes[].

* Zai (before Pu)
* Pu (wife's great-grandfather)
* Yu (wife's grandfather)
* Heng (wife's father)
* Qi (wife)
* Dao (wife's children). At least one thing is decided from this: Ciro's children Chinese names will all be Ai Dao Something.

The family tree that Ciro has reconstructed orally from his mother-in-law is:

* Ciro's wife:
** Father: Ai Dayi (艾大义) born: 1932 in Shenyang, see also: <<ciro-santilli-s-father-in-law>>
*** Father: Ai Xikang (艾锡康) So why did he not use Yu?
**** Father: Ai Pushan (艾溥?), so the Pu character is presumed from the generation name, to be the same generation as Puyi. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaitao has a Pushen (溥伸), but he died at 13 years old in 1928, so its not the one.
**** Younger brother 2: Ai Xiyuan (艾锡?) Professor at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University_(China) Apparently had no Children.
**** Younger brother 3: Ai Xicong (艾锡?) Graduated in law in Japan in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waseda_University[Waseda University] Was the top official of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Agency_(Japan) in China when it was occupied by Japan (警察廳长) Passed first by Taiwan.
**** Younger brother 4: Ai Xiying (艾锡?)
**** Younger brother 5: Ai Xifu (艾锡?) Together with Ai Xiying, they were went to the Republic of China Military Academy and were high ranking officials in the war against the Japanese in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War[] (八年抗战). Later was a congressman in Taiwan.
** Younger sister: Ai Shiping (艾世？)
** Older brother: Zhao Yingjie. Studied law in Japan also at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waseda_University[Waseda University].

Many of them have had different names in different places/countries, notably many used the name 肇(Zhao) rather than 艾.

Further anecdotal indicators follow.

Ciro's wife and family are clearly of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people[Manchu ethnicity] just by looking at them, and they originally lived in the North East of China

Ciro's wife's family name is the 艾, pronounced "ai4", which she claims is a reference to the 愛 (also pronounced ai4) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisin_Gioro[Aisin Gioro] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/爱新觉罗氏[愛新覺羅氏]), which is the name of the Manchu ruling clan of the Qing dynasty.

艾 iself is however a somewhat common family name, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_(surname) mentions that it is listed in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Family_Surnames[Hundred Family Surnames] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/百家姓[百家姓]), a list of common surnames compiled in the <<song-dynasty>> with around 400.000 members as of 2008. Presumably members of the falling Qing dynasty chose that relatively common Chinese name to avoid persecution, while still retaining a bit of their history.

[[ciro-santilli-s-father-in-law]]
==== Ciro Santilli's father-in-law (三西猴的)

Ciro's father-in-law, who he barely met, was very old when he had Ciro's wife, and passed away before Ciro could talk a lot with him, they only saw each other once or twice over Skype, he died soon afterwards.

Having a child late which is consistent with the claims that he spent several years in jail during <<mao-zedong,Mao's>> purges, see also: <<wife>>. Being an educated person was a crime in those days, and he was a chemical engineer.

His brother and sister both managed to escape to the USA and Japan, but he took his grandma's advice and stayed in China.

Ciro's wife adores her father, who she strongly resembles, and it is a huge shame Ciro didn't manage to meet him better.

Like his daughter, he was a bibliophile, foodie, Buddhist and incredibly morally upright.

The fact that he survived so many years in prison also attests to his incredible hopefulness and mental health: <<ciro-santilli-s-mother-in-law>> always tells how many other prisoners killed themselves in those days out of hopelessness. Ciro's wife shares that amazing quality, which Ciro also believes is compatible with the Royalty theory.

After jail, he actually stayed in the same shitty city where he had been imprisoned, and continued to work as a chemical engineer to make a living and try and improve the country that had so badly betrayed him a few years back.

He also seemed to be an amazing story teller, of which he knew many. At one point, a jail cook took him under his wing, even tough he did not know how to cook too well yet, just to hear his stores. Being highly intelligent, the father-in-law man learned to cook too of course.

Another remarkable episode is when he was working in the prison kitchen, and some man was starving and asked for food. He told the man to come later during the evening. The man came, and he gave him a bowl that seemed to be full of cooked vegetables (likely 白菜). The next day, the man came back, and kowtowed him. Beneath the vegetables, he had hidden some good chunks of then very precious meat!! This story https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality[makes Ciro cry].

[[preconceived]]
==== Ciro Santilli has a preconceived opinion about China that cannot be changed (三西猴对中国成见很深，无法改变)

<<ciro-santilli>> tries to justify why he think China would be <<richer,better with democracy>>, but I know that ultimately all of this is useless.

Everyone's opinions are all determined genetically and by <<brainwashed-by-usa,bring-up>>, and there is nothing he can do to change yours, or you change his.

From that point of view, all of this is just a cold blooded political game, in which Ciro tries to force the CCP to take down the Firewall: <<why-keyword-attack>>.

Ciro never gets mad about China, even if your opinion is contrary to his, and therefore wrong.

Using the <<reply-policy,reply policy>> is one of the reasons why Ciro never gets mad.

Ciro also has doubts about the efficiency of certain things I do as expressed throughout this FAQ, e.g. <<embargo>>.

Also, Ciro have never said that anyone else is wrong.

In the end, he just end up thinking about new replies to things people say to him, and add them to this FAQ so that future replies will be faster to copy paste. See also: <<better-to-do>>.

The real goal of any online discussion, is not to convince people, but rather to determine who is an ally and who is not, and get those allies together to defeat the commies.

[[flg-bias]]
==== Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong just because his wife and mother-in-law do it? (三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)

Not consciously, Ciro thinks would likely support them even if I didn't have family ties to <<falun-gong>>.

Likely he wouldn't have started this campaign if he didn't know them of course.

But of course, this is impossible to answer objectively.

Wouldn't you be rather upset if your <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days>>?

But don't you think that <<flg-important,**70 million** people (6% of the total population in 2000!)>> getting completely squashed by the Party illustrates extremely well the dangers of the dictatorship?

Or if a <<nazi,Jew has escaped a concentration camp>> and told the world about its horrors, would you just dismiss their claims due to their biased opinion?

With that in mind, Ciro tries his best to give FLG only the right level of exposure I think it deserves relative to other events, according to these guidelines: <<keyword-choice>>.

If more recent events of mass human rights violations happen, especially affecting in the order of tens of million people, I will probably rank higher than Falun Gong, this was the case for <<xinjiang,Xinjiang in 2019>> for example, even though it only affected a measly million.

[[why-did-ciro-santilli-start-his-keyword-attack]]
==== Why did Ciro Santilli start his keyword attack? (为什么三西猴开始他的关键字攻击？)

The last straw that led <<ciro-santilli>> to start the <<keyword-attack>> on <<stack-overflow>> was when on March 2015 his girlfriend's mother was arbitrarily kept 15 days in jail for doing <<falun-gong>>. He posted about this at:

* https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/579270450984984576
* https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/952661734753174

He then continued because he hate political <<censorship,censorship>>, and because <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,I love China>>.

Every time Ciro thinks about this, he notices how stupid humans are. We see the forest fire smoke, and just never think that it will ever reach your home on the border of the forest.

Until it actually does, and then you are really fucked.

So in a sense it was a good thing that Ciro had this little backyard fire with this mother-in-law, as it woke him up further to how serious the CCP thread was, and led him to action.

Because before that, he was one of the majority who just constantly hears about the increasing mountain of evidence of human rights violations, and does nothing about it.

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkest_Hour_(film)[Darkest Hour (2017) film] comes to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA1Uz_TMzhs[]. The movie shows that Britain was truly hesitant whether to negotiate or fight Hitler, even after the Nazis had already started invading other European countries, and would clearly not stop. Luckily, we are not at a position of war yet, and might never be due to nuclear weapons. But still, a similar blindness applies. <<covid>> woke up many people, but even then some haven't faced it.

====== Jail post en

My girlfriend's mother, a 63 year old lady, was kept 15 days inside a Chinese "correctional facility" because she does Falun Gong.

She had to stay all the time in a small room with a bed and a toilet, under video surveillance, being fed three meager meals a day.

I see Falun Gong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong as just another <<flg-religion,moderate religion>> which causes no harm to its believers. The only reason that it is unofficially outlawed in China is because the communists fear it as a political competitor.

There was no trial and no explanation. She was going to take a train to visit her sister. But she didn't know that there was an important political event happening in the capital: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress So the police at the station, who already knew she did Falun Gong, took her away.

When she came back home, the house had been searched and was all messed up. Her religious books and computer were missing.

I'm glad she was not physically harmed. I find it fascinating how even well educated Chinese support a government which simply does not represent some of its people. How will you feel <<intolerance,when something like that happens to your own family, and there is nothing you can do about it>>?

Translation by <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,my wife>>:

我女朋友的母亲，一位63岁的女士被监禁在一个中国的"劳教所"，只因为她炼法轮功。

她被迫待在一个小屋子里面，只有一张床和一个排泄的地方，一直处在监视器下，每天两个窝头一碗只有几个白菜叶的汤。

我看过法轮功https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong 只是一个和平的信仰，对相信它的人没有任何坏处。它在中国被非官方的定为违法（其实没有一项明确法律禁止），唯一的原因就是工产党害怕它是一个政治竞争对手。

没有审讯没有任何解释。她正准备坐火车去看她的姐姐。但是她并不知道那个时候有重要的政治会议正在首都进行：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress
所以那些知道她炼法轮功的铁路警察把她带走了。

当她回到家中时，房子被搜查过了，四处一切混乱。她的信仰书籍和电脑都没有了。

我很庆幸的是她身体并没有受到伤害。我觉得很意思的是一些受过良好教育的中国人怎么能够迫害一部分它的人民的政府呢？如果这样的事情发生在你的家庭，而你什么都不能做，你会怎么想？

Translation by myself:

A mãe da minha namorada ficou 15 dias num "centro de correção" chines porque ela faz Falun Gong.

Ela ficou o tempo todo num quarto pequeno com uma cama e banheiro, sobe videovigilância, recebendo 3 refeições pequenas por dia.

Para mim, o Falun Gong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong é apenas mais uma religião moderada que não causa nenhum problema para seus crentes. A única razão pela qual ele é proibido na China é porque os comunistas tem medo dele como competidor politico.

Não houve julgamento nem explicação. Ela ia pegar um trem para ver sua irmã, mas ela não sabia que teria um evento político importante na capital: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People's_Congress Então a polícia da estação, que já sabia que ela faz Falun Gong pegou ela.

Quando ela voltou pra casa, a casa tinha sido procurada pela polícia e estava uma bagunça. Os livros religiosos e seu computador foram confiscados.

Eu fico feliz apenas que ela não sofreu abuso físico. Eu acho fascinante como mesmo muitos chineses educados apoiam ainda um governo que não representa parte do povo. Como você vai se sentir quando algo do tipo acontecerá com a sua família, e você não pode fazer nada sobre isso?

March 2015: 15 days in jail for no reason: https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/952661734753174[]. They took her computer. When she left jail, she asked to get it back, and a cop said they would only give it back if she paid 10,000 yuan for it.

June 2017: 3 cops came to her house. She was there. They asked if she still did Falun Gong. She said yes. They took photos of her Falun Gong books/posters. They were polite.

October 2017: 7 - 8 cops came to her house _at 11PM_. They knocked the door strongly and made noise, and questioned neighbours of her whereabouts. Luckily she was not there.

In Episode 7, Stierlitz travels on a train with a Nazi officer.

The war is almost over, and the desolate officer tells Stierlitz:

____
I told my children: I hate any democracy!

No democracy in our Reich!

Any democracy in our country is doomed to end up with one thing: the dictatorship of small shopkeepers.

The more freedom we have, the sooner we want to be controlled by SS troops again.

And then we want our the secret police back, and concentration death camps again, and the universal fear everywhere! Only then we feel calm and secure.

No need to prove your point of view in defending the fate of the homeland.

No responsibility.

===== Most Chinese people like their dictatorship (中国大众支持他们的独裁)

It is easy to reach an agreement, when <<chinese-dissidents,everyone who disagrees>> goes to jail or gets killed for to <<inciting-subversion>> or <<picking-quarrels>>.

This is exactly <<goring-nuremberg,Herman Goring said in his appearances on the Nuremberg trials>> to justify <<nazi,the atrocities of Nazism>>.

Also ask the millions of people who were affected by <<tiananmen>>, <<falun-gong>>, <<xinjiang>> or <<dissidents>>.

One is reminded of the game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Happy_Few["We Happy Few" (2018)], which which people are forced to be happy. <<nineteen-eighty-four>> also comes to mind of course.

The interesting thing, is that even those pro-CCP are much more likely to stay anonymous because:

* you never know when something you said will become a sin against some new trend of the dictatorship
* when the dictatorship inevitably falls, you would be persecuted by the victorious freedom fighters

.Westerner: "How is life in China?" Chinese: "Oh, we can't complain." Westerner: "That's awesome." Chinese: "No, seriously... we can't." is a word play between the more common "we can't complain because everything is great" and "we can't complain because <<xi-jinping,Xi>> will <<censorship,make us disappear>>". https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3933168[Source]

Each time, Goring replied that such acts might be considered crimes in a democratic state, but that in Germany, democracy had failed. Eliminating the political opposition was necessary, to fulfill a higher principle: that of the Nation. And that it had worked, Goring insisted. It had brought order and prosperity to Germany". Jackson asks: "Well, if you wanted a certain people killed, you would have to have some organization that would kill them didn't you?". Goring replies: "This was the only possible form of government at the time and it proved that Germany could be pulled out of the abyss of misery, poverty and unemployment and withing a short space of time be made flourish and bloom." This is _exactly_ the justification given by the <<ccp,CCP>> for oppressing minorities and <<censorship,freedom of speech>>: the CCP is indistinguishable from the <<nazi,Nazis>>.

[[chilling-effect]]
====== Chilling effect (寒蝉效应)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/寒蟬效應_(法律)

It is really interesting to see how many people star the <<mirrors,GitHub repository>>, and then a few minutes later they think about how they might get put in jail, and then unstar it.

Unstarring events are exceedingly rare in Ciro's other repositories.

The expression https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-expression-two-steps-forward-one-step-back-mean[two steps forward, one step back] comes to mind.

Luckily in this case, it does not seem possible to view who unstarred a repository after the fact:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51072418/how-can-i-determine-when-a-user-unstarred-a-repo-using-the-github-graphql-api

video::_-hCdbsyWw0[youtube,height=400,width=600]

====== View all users who starred a repository on GitHub including those who unstarred

The <<chilling-effect>> is extremelly visible on GitHub.

<<ciro-santilli>> is able to see this easily because the star notification remains in the GitHub dashboard even after unstarring.

However, star events are also publicly visible permanently on events API under the WatchEvent: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/events/github-event-types#watchevent

This appears to get them all from https://www.gharchive.org/[GitHub Archive]'s Google BigQuery up to the last whole month:

....
SELECT actor.login, MAX(created_at)
FROM `githubarchive.month.*`
WHERE type = 'WatchEvent'
AND repo.name = 'cirosantilli/china-dictatorship'
GROUP BY actor.login
ORDER BY MAX(created_at) DESC
....

Ciro verified that does include people who unstarred.

That one exceeds the free data limits as of December 2021 however, so you need to select more specific months/years at a time. Note that year data is only released once every year.

The following ranges manage to get all data as December 2021 for free:

....
FROM `githubarchive.year.201*`
FROM `githubarchive.year.202*`
FROM `githubarchive.month.2021*`
....

supposing that unique starrers

You can then "Save results" as CSV to view all users.

There don't appear to be unstar events however. You can see single people star multiple times, which means that each new star gives a new row, which is why we do the `GROUP BY`.

[[intolerance]]
===== Most Chinese people don't care about the minorities (大多数中国人不关心少数民族)

How can you be that certain that your children won't have dissident ideas and be punished unfairly for them?

Intolerance is a risky way to live. Everyone is part of one minority in one way. If all minorities were oppressed, everyone would be oppressed.

Dictatorships crush minorities much more than democracies.

Do think the majority of the Chinese people would vote to put 50 year old <<falun-gong>> meditating <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,aunties in jail>>, if the CCP hadn't made a huge propaganda campaign and used an iron fist?

Are the Chinese really that selfish to vote for this oppression, even as the <<censorship,free media>> would show videos of meditating old ladies in jail on national television? <<ciro-santilli>> does not believe this.

Minorities are put in jail because the CCP fears them. Dictatorships can only survive if there is zero difference in opinion in the population.

The famous quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Beatrice_Hall[Evelyn Beatrice Hall] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/伊夫林·比阿特丽斯·霍尔[伊夫林·比阿特丽斯·霍尔]) comes to mind:

Every form of protest incurs some damage. E.g., if we manifest on the street, it generates a traffic jam.

<<ciro-santilli>> doesn't like it, but he thinks it is worth it.

If you just work to make money and have a good life, without any plans to improve the government, you are just making the economy of the dictatorship stronger, then when they start a <<war,war>> or kill yet another minority, blood will also be on your hands. See also: <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china>>.

====== If anyone disagrees with the government they must be punished to keep the stability of the country (如果有人不同意政府，他们必须受到惩罚以保持国家的稳定)

Destroying diversity is the best way to reach a point where everyone can agree to start <<war,a new big war and destroy everything>>.

The CCP thrives on the excessive <<evil-west,fear it instigates into its own people>>.

How can society improve, if we are never allowed to try new things out?

Change in democracies does not require <<violence,violence>>. Violence happens because the government punishes any dissidence, even if pacific, to retain its own power.

In democracies, radical policy changes happen without dropping a single drop of blood. People vote, and policies change, end of the story. In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy[JFK's] words:

[[why-china]]
=== There are bad things happening all over the world, why doesn't Ciro Santilli fight for those causes as well/instead? (世界各地都有不好的事情发生，为什么三西猴不为这些原因而战/相反？)

We have to choose the one we think is the worst, and focus on it.

What is worse is a subjective choice. For <<ciro-santilli>>:

* he <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,loves China and Ciro's Chinese wife>>, see also: <<bias>>, and doesn't want it to get fucked further by the CCP
* he hates dictatorships, and China is the largest one by population/GDP/link:https://www.ploughshares.org/world-nuclear-stockpile-report[nuclear stockpile], and therefore <<war,the most dangerous>>

Ciro <<keyword-choice,SO username>> and <<better-to-do,protest time>> are not infinite.

However, it is good that different people have different interests, and someone will surely be fighting for whatever cause you care about.

[[western-democracies-are-not-perfect]]
==== Western democracies are not perfect (西方的民主有很多缺点)

That is definitely true.

Nothing is perfect in this world.

<<ciro-santilli>> just believes that they are way better than a <<dictatorship>> like China, and that the Chinese government <<evil-west,brainwashes its people to think that the West is evil to stay in power>>.

As link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority[Churchill] once brilliantly link:https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government[put it]:

____
Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.
____

However, this is all obviously subjective, and believing that dictatorship is a better form of government is also a valid belief, e.g. <<dictatorship-variability>>.

If you find an event on a Western democracy that you would like to highlight, send a pull request.

We will not however include events that are not currently censored.

Every country did fucked-up things in the past, the question is if they currently allow discussion about it or not.

Posts that only mention <<evil-west,"evil West">> non-censored events without adding anything to the discussion will be marked as <<shitpost>> and treated as such, since spamming those is the primary <<wumao>> technique to stop intelligent discussion.

The reason why "Evil China" posts are not shitposts in general on the other hand, is that they have one specific purpose: <<why-keyword-attack, to destroy censorship>>.

The wumao used this to criticize Guantanamo bay, saying that it was like <<xinjiang-re-education-camps>> but in the USA, apparently unaware that this was a staged protest. So it actually has the exact opposite effect than intended: because there is no <<censorship>>, here people in the West can together to denounce something they don't like. Imagine if a crowd of 100 people in China got together to denounce the Xinjiang camps! They'd go to jail immediately. Furthermore as Ciro repeated a million times: Guantanamo bay detainees are not American citizens, and democracies cannot fully protect people who can't vote. In China however, no one can vote, so everyone can be oppressed. https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/171145[Source].

[[racist]]
====== You criticized China so you are racist (你批评中国，所以你是种族主义者)

As of the 2020's, given the importance of <<politically-incorrect,political correctness>> in the West, some <<wumao,wumaos>> have tried to turn to this line of defense.

Of course, it rarely works, because criticizing a government is different from criticizing a race.

This is something however that wumaos have trouble understanding, because their <<nazi,Nazi>> estate insists that <<the-group-is-the-only-way>>, and that CCP equals China.

This does however highlight one of the fundamental dangers of any type of <<censorship>>, including political correctness: what if you are criticizing something that is actually bad?

In it, Aaron describes his experiences with the recruitment team of one of his former employers, an unnamed "Chinese ed-tech company in Beijing", for which he worked in human resources. In another also deleted video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6uFGGunRxc he mentions that he cannot mention the name of the company because he was under NDA.

Notably, in that video, he gives several screenshots of Google Sheets spreadsheets with explicitly racist reasons why people were not hired, one of which is <<we-dont-hire-blacks-screenshot,reproduced here>>. Examples of such reasons include:

* "Skin color"
* "Non-Caucasian"
* "62-years old"
* "elderly"
* "Hispanic"

He mentions:

____
On the first day at this company, I had an orientation with my supervisor Ng, who is the head of the training department. She told me:

which would lead parents to just go to a competitor instead. Then he mentions about the Google Sheets documents that:

____
They shared this document with the entire management team in Beijing, and everyone not only knew, but expected this discrimination to take place.
____

In the video he also explains how he once went to a 2 week holiday to Bali, and when he came back with his skin darker due to the tanning, he was reprimanded by a manager, who said that he could not work looking like that.

He explicitly mentions later the video that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIPKid[VIPKid], for which he did not work, is a similar company in nature, but not the one he is talking about.

Wikipedia mentions about VIPKid

____
Its online-classroom portal enables students to receive 25-minute English language lessons from fluent English-speaking teachers.

In March 2019, VIPKid fired two American teachers for discussing the 1989 <<tiananmen>> and <<taiwan>> with their students in China. Teachers have also reported witnessing child abuse when teaching lessons, but they found little recourse to report such issues.
____

As of 2021-05-05, the banner image of VIPKid's website explicitly includes a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism[token black person]: https://web.archive.org/web/20210505045920/https://www.vipkid.com/[], so their PR department clearly caught air of this. This is however only a frontend for hiring American teachers. The real Chinese client website https://www.vipkid.com.cn/[], rest assured, contains no black people: (https://web.archive.org/web/20210424032446/https://www.vipkid.com.cn/[archive])

VIPKids had a 3 billion valuation in https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/chinas-vipkid-which-links-native-english-speakers-with-online-learners-raises-another-500m-reportedly-at-3b-valuation/

Wikipedia links as one of its sources to this 2019 article https://www.wired.com/story/when-online-teaching-job-becomes-window-child-abuse/[] which mentions:

____
Of the dozens of companies vying to cash in on the tutoring business, it is by far the largest, having raised $825 million in investment capital since its founding. Other major players include Qkids, Magic Ears, DaDa, and Gogokid, all based in China. 
____

so it is overwhelmingly likely that one of those is the one mentioned Aaron is talking about:

* Qkids
* Magic Ears
* DaDa
* Gogokid

Later in the video Aaron mentions that the company in question "basically went bankrupt".

He also mentions that he later worked for https://www.forbes.com/companies/offcn-education-technology/?sh=6d49822b4e45[offcn], which is run by the Chinese Government, and they would absolutely not hire black people.

[[western-democracies-have-invaded-other-countries-and-crushed-separatism]]
===== Western democracies have invaded other countries and crushed separatism (西方民主国家侵略别国粉碎分裂主义)

Yes, <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect,Western democracies are not perfect>>.

What matters is that citizens can disagree with those actions, publicly say it, vote accordingly, and not go to jail, so that policy will be changed if the majority so wants.

In China, the minority controls the majority, and the majority cannot say anything even if they disagree.

If the majority wants to do evil however, evil will get done, it is impossible to prevent that.

People from other countries don't vote for your politicians in democracy. Therefore, democracies cannot protect them.

What democracy does do well is to <<brainwashed-by-usa,reduce the chance that enough of the population will be brainwashed>> into <<war,starting war with other superpowers and destroy the world>>.

Do you really think <<chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens,China wouldn't invade a country they need resources from because they are more humane>>?

<<too-young-too-naive>>. China is already invading its own citizens right now as of 2020 to obtain resources! <<xinjiang-re-education-camps>>. And it is using the exact same excuse as the American politicians: terrorism!

Even when the US invades another country, the people who support the US enemy can still pick up arms and fight. And Russia can send help if they want to annoy the Americans, making local resistance stand an actual chance. But when you oppress your own people, they are completely defenseless, and 100% certain to be fully oppressed, since no foreign country would risk world war 3 by sending help.

Do you really think that the CCP would give a fuck about invading other countries? And furthermore, China is specifically oppressing Islamic people in Xinjiang, exactly the same religion of people who live where? In the Middle East.

Xinjiang _is_ China's Middle East.

The reason the USA has invaded countries in the Middle east and China hasn't yet is a mixture of:

* the USA is more developed, and has greater fuel needs, and greater capacity to carry such a war.
+
Although as we've seen, they've been essentially losing those wars quite often now, by not saying long enough to establish a new stable government.
+
Part of their defeat is also due to <<russia>>, and increasingly China, helping the other side however.
* the Middle East is full of dictatorships, and <<dictatorships-tend-to-work-together,dictatorships are natural allies of other dictatorships>> therefore it is more likely that they won't invade one another.
* the Cold War is still fresh in the American mind. Oil is crucial to fight a war. Countries will do anything to survive, even if it means killing others.

<<ciro-santilli>> is not saying that any of this justifies the actions of the Western powers in the Middle East. But simply that it has nothing to do with democracy or non-democracy.

[[hate-speech]]
===== Western democracies also censor subjects such as child porn and hate speech (西方民主国家也审查儿童色情和仇恨言论等主题)

First, child porn and hate speech are also banned in China, so shut up. <<china-has-more-freedom-of-speech-than-the-usa,every type of speech>> is less free in <<dictatorship>>.

Second, if you don't think child porn should be banned, there isn't much point in arguing with you.

Now, hate speech is a very complex subject. <<ciro-santilli>> does feel that we should be very careful when banning hate speech, and he is not sure if it should be banned at all, as perhaps it might just make matters worse.

But of course, there is also censorship in Western democracies, and there is a gray area between what should be censored or not.

<<ciro-santilli>> only argues that there is on type of speech that must never ever be <<censorship,censored>>: political speech.

This way, the majority can always discuss and vote to change what can be censored or not.

In China, however, trying to discuss such changes in laws <<internal-censorship,puts you in jail>>, so bad laws cannot be changed. This lack of freedom <<most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship,also gives the impression to many brainwashed Chinese>> that dicatorships are better because you see less conflict online. Which is great, until your human rights are violated, and you've got no one to talk to.

The lack of ability to discuss political problems leads to extremely serious problems:

* <<corruption>>: politicians can <<internal-censorship,censor>> anything bad that they did to stay in power
* <<war>>: if the CCP leaders decide that a war must be made, everyone who opposes it will go to jail, and the war will be made
* <<intolerance>>: if the CCP decides that <<xinjiang,some minority>> is <<falun-gong,a danger to their power>>, this minority gets fucked

Deciding on hate speech, means having to decide what level of hardcoreness we are willing to accept, and there is no clear right or wrong answer.

For example, which of the following do you think should be banned:

* This scientific study suggests that white people do less well in IQ tests.
* This scientific study suggests that black people do less well in IQ tests.
* I'm an idiotic irrational racist and I dislike white/black people. I won't kill them, but I dislike them, and I can't change that, I'm really sorry.
* Let's all gather together and kill our black/white/gay/straight/Muslim/Christian neighbours tomorrow.
* Let's all gather together and kill our oppressive dictator/president tomorrow.

Ciro believes that none of the above should ever be censored, because any form of "hate-speech censorship" immediately opens a precedent for political censorship.

If someone is idiotic enough to organize illegal acts like hurting someone publicly before doing it, it will just make it easier for them to get caught.

And if its just empty words, just block those idiots to not see their posts, or downvotes their posts to reduce their impact.

And if the majority supports idiotic acts like killing someone because of their race, it will get done in a democracy regardless, because that's what democracies do: they cater to what the majority wants.

There's not point in censoring them. Such censorship only makes things worse, as the perpetrators will use that as publicity for their cause.

[[fake-news]]
====== Fake news (假新闻)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/假新聞

When a government controls all information to make it look good, and no one can challenge it, you cannot trust _any_ of the news produced by that country, as anything could be fake.

It is much better to have some fake news, but also few sources that are likely telling the truth.

<<ciro-santilli>> is also extremely critical of Western social media companies such as <<twitter>> and Facebook which have censored "fake news" from real legitimate accounts or real people, which is a point that Trump has justly criticized in Ciro's opinion.

If it is from a Chinese/Russian botnet, sure, destroy those accounts.

But from legitimate accounts of citizens? The people have to decide for themselves what is fake or real, not you, Twitter and Facebook. If the majority is made of idiots who believe in fake news, then so be it, that's how democracy works.

Censoring any citizen, no matter how stupid you think they are, creates a precedent for dictatorship, and even an <<luxor,incentive to terrorism>>.

More interesting case is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_First_Amendment_Institute_v._Trump[]. Ciro feels strongly that people who try to have meaningful discussions on Twitter should automatically lose a lawsuit, and that people should be able to block whoever they want from their personal controlled accounts or forums. It is only the companies who provide the forum service that must be neutral.

____

because they thought Trump would become sad and cry.

And politicians don't really care enough. Partially because:

* corporations pay for their election campaigns
* many of the politicians are rich themselves

But do you really think that further increasing the power concentration as done is China is going to help reduce inequality?

If so, you have been <<stupid,brainwashed beyond reason>>. Increasing the concentration of power <<chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens,will obviously make society even more unequal>> and <<corruption,corrupt>>, never less.

[[snowden]]
===== Snowden (斯诺登)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/爱德华·斯诺登

Censoring anyone who says "my president is shit", which is what China does, is much, much more serious than censoring intelligence leaks.

The problem with dictatorships, is that they make _every_ information that makes them look bad a "state secret". Including any information that hundreds of thousands of people have witnessed, or economic performance metrics! See also: <<internal-censorship>>.

The level of unknown surveillance that Snowden uncovered is a bad thing about the US.

Snowden's prosecution was inevitable. Countries need secret services. Secret services need laws that prevent leaking classified information that was produced by government officials.

<<ciro-santilli>> has never and will never criticize China or any other country for spying or prosecuting spies.

If Snowden were Chinese, the Chinese government would ban talking about him or anything he uncovered. A <<keyword-attack,keyword attack>> with "Snowden" in the West has no effect.

It is obvious that the level of surveillance in any dictatorship will be infinitely higher, since the Government has much more power and no-one can criticize.

On the West however, the debate Snowden sparked cannot be censored, and has helped to control excessive and secret state power.

Ultimately, Ciro thinks camera surveillance is somewhat inevitable, because people will always want to fight crime and terrorism and surveillance technology keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.

He is however strictly against the ban of cryptography.

He also believes that a good solution to balance out government power is the <<second-amendment>>. It is better to have more school shootings and less full-blown dictatorship led genocides / mass human rights violations.

In 2019 China amusingly censored passages Snowden's "Permanent Record" autobiography book, which Snowden then published on Twitter:

* https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784 (https://web.archive.org/web/20191112083232/https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784[archive])

As a https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/f7axckl/[Redditor put it]:

____
I don't think they understand that what Snowden stands for is completely the opposite of what the Chinese gov is lol

Snowden then later released the entire Chinese version of the book for free online with the censored parts underlined: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship (https://web.archive.org/web/20200213001653/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship[archive]), link to the book: link:++https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf++[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200212144108/https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf[archive]). One wonders why he didn't just do that in the first place for all versions, maybe he needed to pay the writer that helped him?

.Snowden highlighted defects on abuses of power in a Western democracy, and the discussion he sparked helped to control such abuses. <<to-obey-is-to-betray,To obey is to betray>> comes to mind. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edward_Snowden-2.jpg[Source].

Democracies cannot necessarily protect weak countries from powerful ones either. No political system can do that, because humans are trash essentially.

What democracy do is to protect its own people against its own government. Because when the government turns against part of the population in a dictatorship, that part of the population gets crushed entirely, without any chance to fight, because they don't have an army or ally countries like other countries do.

==== Chinese politicians really care about the Chinese citizens (中国政客真正关心中国公民)

Sometimes people say Ciro Santilli is naive.

Politicians are the same all over the world.

Some might have good intentions, but most don't give a shit about anyone else.

But all must play a careful political game, and sometimes betray their own beliefs to not lose power entirely.

Even those that genuinely care might have to play such political games.

China's problem is not its politicians.

It's the current shitty political organization, which allows/convinces those politicians to do really bad things: <<richer>>, <<war>> and <<corruption>>.

Western politicians don't care about the people either: <<western-society-is-extremely-unequal>>. But at least they have to pretend a little.

[[nazi]]
=== Comparisons between the CCP and Nazi Germany (纳粹德国和中共长得很想)

The more <<ciro-santilli>> learns about the Nazis, the more similar they CCP looks to them. As of 2020, the <<ccp>> is much more like Nazi Germany than it is like the <<soviet-union>>.

Both CCP and Nazis share the same basic core ideology: capitalism, <<little-pink-american-dream-vs-chinese-dream,love your country/leader mindlessly>>, work hard, <<most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship,throw any dissidents under the bus>>, and <<overlook-human-rights-for-profit,everyone will become richer>> (except the dissidents who will be in jail or dead).

Thankfully, the CCP is possibly less bad as of 2020 it has less of "this minority (Jews) is the cause of all our problems/racial supremacy approach". But everything else, and arguably the key points that got most German people on-board in the first place, are so similar, that it has to raise huge red flags.

We must however be careful not to demonize the Nazis, as that is not a helpful way to learn from the past.

The Nazis were also people like us, and that is the scary thing we must never forget, thus we should never fall for:

* Xitler (习特勒). 习 "xi2" is very close in sound to the Chinese name of Hitler: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿道夫·希特勒[希特勒] (xi1 te4 le4)
* Chinazi (赤纳粹 Chi Na Cui). TODO why 赤. Means Red, which is a reference to Communism, although red was of course it was also the color of the original Nazis. But where else is it used? Chi is also chosen to achieve the sound "Chi Na" as a variant of <<shina>>

https://www.southbankresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/ZHA-issue-2510-free.pdf has a good quote:
____
Would you have stood up to Hitler when he came to power? Or would you have been an appeaser, like Chamberlain? Or perhaps even a supporter of fascism, like the Daily Mail's owner at the time?

We all like to imagine we're courageous enough to stand up to tyranny and persecution. That we would have stood up to the villains of the past. Seen them for what they really were, even helped rescue their victims from danger. We certainly don't like to think we would have bought their goods or funded, invested in their economies...

Well today, you're going to find out what you're made of.

==== I want to take my chances and make a shitpost in cirosantilli/china-dictatorship (屎帖子)

So, have you reached the conclusion that your https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shitposting[shitpost] is link:CONTRIBUTING.md[worth the risk of getting blocked]?

Remember that shitposts can also be creative: if you are going to insult Ciro Santilli, at least do it in a creative way, or else you look like an even bigger idiot than you really are.

A collection of shitposts for you to take inspiration from can be found at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Ashitpost+

Also, when opening a shitpost you may mark it clearly such with the shitpost issue template which automatically assigns the shitpost label. Doing so will make you look like less of an idiot.

While we require polite replies to polite posts, no matter what which side they are defending, if a post is marked as a shitpost, things are much more relaxed and fun, and you can generally get away with telling the OP to fuck themselves link:CONTRIBUTING.md[without getting blocked].

==== I am going to write a huge wall of text to prove my point

Feel free to do that, but no one will ever read most of it.

If you want your comment to be read, choose your key point well, and deliver it.

It is a shame that most people who are ever able to do that are <<shitpost,shitposters>>, but credit where credit is due.

==== Can I contact Ciro Santilli in Chinese? (我可以用中文联系三西猴吗？)

If you don't know English well enough, that's fine though, go for Chinese, Ciro Santilli will likely understand it: <<does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese>>.

But if you do, use English.

Ciro is not going to learn Chinese because of your message.

It is more productive for you to write in English, so that the rest of the West can also learn something new.

Especially since it seems that most Chinese already know what you are talking about, so you are better off teaching Western people about it.

[[slang]]
===== I am going to use a bunch of Chinese slangs because it makes me feel smart (我知道网络语言，我很聪明)

Obviously, if you want to be understood, use simple and standard Chinese, since as Ciro has already stated clearly, his Chinese sucks: <<does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese>>.

Avoid slangs, otherwise Ciro might not have patience to Google your useless slangs down <<zhihu,Zhihu>> questions.

Of course, if you have to read this, you likely are not going to say anything useful in the first place, so not reading your post is likely fine, just make sure to mark it as a <<shitpost>> if you don't want Ciro to think you are a complete idiot.

Using slangs makes some people feel smart due their advanced knowledge of a specific subculture, or makes them feel part of that subculture to gather allies. I.e., it is a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth[shibboleth]. It mainly comes down to a way of avoiding any rational conversation about China's obvious problems by highlighting <<not-chinese>>.

Or maybe they just want to waste Ciro's time.

Such idiots don't see however that every major slang is Googleable, and that every overly obscure slang is already not understandable by a large part of the Chinese population, and won't be understood by anybody in 5 years, so that you are wasting your time writing this gibberish. But since you are an idiot, it's not like you have anything better to do with your time, so maybe it doesn't matter.

If you want to efficiently prevent anyone from understanding your stuff, Ciro recommends that you just use SHA-256 instead:

....
$ printf 'heil xi' | sha256sum
286b183bf41d6c9de5315bbd64f1ca35a58157ae2e7f38086978c108e67c4882  -
....

A Chinese insult tip 101, avoid similar sound euphemisms. If you are going to say shit at least grow some balls or tits and use the proper characters, Ciro will respect you more for it:

* 屄 cunt, most often for https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/傻屄[傻屄]
** 逼
*** "sb"
*** "B": https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/105
*** "BB" TODO https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/37819380.html
* 肏 fuck: 操
* 傻 idiot: 沙
* 屌 dick: 屌

Places to try and decrypt Internet slang when you feel like wasting your time:

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中国大陆网络用语列表
** "网络用语" is the most common word for "Internet Slang", so also useful for Google searches
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Internet_slang

Random slangs of interest and related concepts:

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/火星文[火星文] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_language[Martian language]). This figures for example in the language rules of the <<ptt>> joke board: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602005687.A.E4D.html (禁止使用簡體字、注音文、火星文、外國語言或其他無法直觀理解之內容作為文章主體).

[[ruhua]]
====== Ruhua (to disgrace china, 辱华, 乳华)

Basically a 2 character slang for <<hurt-the-feelings-of-the-chinese-people>> which cool people in the web use:

* https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75717383 天天辱华，辱华的到底是谁？ on <<zhihu>>
* https://www.dw.com/zh/一系列国际大牌纷纷陷入辱华风波/a-49994530 on <<dw>>
* https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-46314935 on <<bbc>>

The pardox is: as soon as you start talking about ruhua, you start to risk getting banned in China, because most of ruhua is banned in China itself.

In this project for example: https://github.com/leiroc/insults the author is aiming to create a list of such insults. So someone came and suggested adding this project to the list at: https://github.com/leiroc/insults/issues/4[], which is obviouly censored in China, as an example. They even have an <<icp-license>> at https://insults.cn/[], isn't that cute?

To which the repo owner replied:

____
感谢提交，这个人有点疯狂了。我就不给加到记录里面了，因为加进去，看到的人就会更加多。对于这些信息不是所有人都有分别真伪的能力。害怕有些人信了他的，或者被他诱导。所以还是让他消声少曝光的好，这些人国家肯定一直在监控的，我们可以放心。
____

Google Translate:

____
Thanks for submitting, this person is a bit crazy. I won't add it to the record, because if you add it, you will see more people. Not everyone has the ability to distinguish between authenticity and falsehood for this information. I'm afraid that some people will believe him or be induced by him. Therefore, it is better to silence him and reduce exposure. These people and countries must have been monitoring them, so we can rest assured.

This perfecly shows the ruhua paradox. In the end, you are only allowed to talk about the most idiotic and insipid events, while censoring any serious self criticism.

<<uneducated-masses>> also comes to mind.

TODO the README says that it is a static blog, but I can't find the source on GitHub anywhere, that repo contains almost nothing.

=== Personal questions about Ciro Santilli (关于三西猴的问题)

[[has-ciro-santilli-you-ever-lived-in-china]]
==== Has Ciro Santilli you ever lived in China? (三西猴住过中国吗？)

Not as of 2019, he has only visited once in 2012, and it was <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,amazingly beautiful>>.

.Ciro Santilli with a stone carved https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai[Budai (布袋和尚)] in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maitreya_and_disciples_carving_in_Feilai_Feng_Caves.jpg[Feilai Feng caves (飞来峰)] near the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingyin_Temple[Lingyin Temple (灵隐寺)] in Hangzhou taken during his legendary 2012 touristic trip to China. Will he ever be able to go to China again to re-experience such marvelous locations? If the CCP falls before he dies, and if the statue hasn't been destroyed by the commies, Ciro will return to that exact spot and take a second picture. How will he look like?
image::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Ciro_Santilli_with_a_stone_carved_Budai_in_the_Feilai_Feng_caves_near_the_Lingyin_Temple_in_Hangzhou_in_2012.jpg[height=500]

But he doesn't think it is a good idea for him to do that now, in case his Visa got accepted, because he is not interested in learning about the Chinese jail system! :-)

He knows that if you don't mind contributing to making <<war,WW3>> deadlier and shut up and obey the CCP, China is already a fine place to live as much as any other developing country.

[[would-ciro-santilli-like-to-live-in-china]]
===== Would Ciro Santilli like to live in China? (三西猴想住在中国吗？)

If the dictatorship ends, <<ciro-santilli>> would like to <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,migrate to China>> if given a decent job to help China develop and become awesomer.

Before the Dictatorship, Ciro likely won't be able to enter/it wouldn't be a good idea: <<would-ciro-santilli-be-able-to-visit-china-before-the-ccp-ends>>.

And it is immoral to help make dictatorships richer by working for their companies: <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china>>.

[[would-ciro-santilli-be-able-to-visit-china-before-the-ccp-ends]]
===== Would Ciro Santilli be able to visit China before the CCP ends? (三西猴能否在中共结束之前访问中国？)

It would be interesting to apply for a VISA to find out.

But Ciro won't do it because it is too risky that it would be a waste of Ciro's precious <<better-to-do,time and money>>.

Firstly, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399[Jamal Khashoggi] taught us that walking into enemy into consulates of enemy countries is a bad idea.

Then, even if the VISA were accepted, Ciro could still be turned back on entering the country, thus wasting the flight time and money. This could either be a genius plot to waste the money of enemies of the state, or due to a crappy divided IT system between the border control and the VISA people.

Finally, even after the border, there is still the possibility that Ciro could be stopped in the country half-way through the visit and sent back, or be interrogated for a few days, or less likely murdered with poison.

Therefore, if you think that living in China is fundamental to understand it, please just explain what you think one can learn from the experience instead. Do you really need to live there to see its censorship machine working? It would arguably be harder to see it from the inside.

As of 2019, oral enough for daily things, but not understand most natural casual dinner conversation or watch TV series, because they go too quickly into vocabulary subject areas that he doesn't know. And obviously, using <<slang,slangs>> just makes things really hard.

When it matters, and with some patience, he can make himself understood though with https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/[some analogies] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190908144612/https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/[archive]) and a dictionary.

From the HSK vocabulary list, he estimates that he is definitely HSK 3, but not quite HSK 4. This would likely equate A2/B1 in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages[European system].

Phonetics wise, Ciro can't distinguish or produce a few sounds, notably `-ing` vs `-in` and his off-tone rate is high, but it tends to not matter at all compared to his lack of vocabulary. Except for his <<wife,mother-in-law>>, who sometimes does not understand it at all without correct tones!

Ciro reads with https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen[] after link:https://www.perapera.org/[Perapera] died when he wants to learn new words/has patience/something is very important, and can basically understand everything in that way. TODO perapera support stopped in 2021: https://www.perapera.org/plugins/ and since browsers don't have stable API's it very quickly stopped working for everyone. Alternatives asked at: https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/78268/on-mouse-hover-pop-up-chinese-dictionary-browser-extension-alternative-to-perape/ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde[Zhongwen] worked, source at https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen

When he has no patience or for larger not very important chunks of text though, he reads with Google Translate as it tends to work, and then if there is an important sentence that was translated to garbage with Perapera.

Ciro writes with a mixture of link:https://www.pleco.com/[Pleco], Google translate and Googling to see if Chinese actually say the sentences that way, never Google translate alone as it would be too imprecise.

Ciro really wishes he could learn more Chinese. Ciro really loves the Chinese language. But he has other more important endeavors at the moment. There simply aren't enough hours in a day.

Spoken Chinese is in Ciro's opinion a relatively easy language to learn from scratch, because word formation is so often logical:, e.g.:

* volcano = fire + mountain: 火山(huo shan)
* train = fire + car: 火车 (huo che), a reference to old https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive[steam locomotives]

and there is no useless crap like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation[verb grammatical conjugation], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender[grammatical gender], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural[plural inflection], capitalization, etc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione[latino sine flexione] anyone?)

Ciro <<characters,hasn't tried to learn characters>> because <<chinese-characters-are-insane,too much effort>>, but he did learn some of the most common ones without trying.

Ciro initially learnt from book that come with audio recordings in the first 6-months to 1 year in 2010, but that got impossibly boring afterward, so he later moved to just basically talking as much as possible non-important things to <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much,his wife in Chinese>>, and whenever he reaches one that he doesn't know that seems useful, he Plecos it up or just 怎么说 to his <<wife>> and then Pleco.

It should also be mentioned that Ciro also feels that it would be better if all countries more officially adopted English as an international language that everyone should learn for reasons explained at: https://cirosantilli.com/#having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world

[[chinese-characters-are-insane]]
===== Chinese characters are insane (汉字是疯狂的)

Maybe the <<ccp,commies>> for once <<richer,did something good>> by introducing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters[simplified Chinese characters (简化字)]?

But they should have gone further and reduced it to pinyin like the Korean and Vietnamese did, this will make your culture much easier to export.

No foreign adult will every learn to read and write Chinese unless they are completely obsessed by the culture or need it as part of their jobs. And even then, they will avoid it at all costs, because life is just too short!

Japanese https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana[furigana] also comes to mind. The characters are so insane that you need to a well specified and widely used phonetic reading aid, especially for teenagers, but likely not only in case of rarer characters! There's even an HTML tag for that for God's sake: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-ruby-element[the HTML Ruby tag].

Yes, ideograms are:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts[vertical text (纵排)] is beautiful.
** the top to bottom aspect is obviously due to the binding of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_and_wooden_slips[bamboo and wooden slips] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/简牍[简牍])

Left to right makes more sense as you don't put your hand on top of the most recent ink: https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Chinese-characters-individually-written-from-left-to-right-yet-in-ancient-times-sentences-of-Chinese-characters-were-written-and-read-from-right-to-left

* more historically stable, and you can still read/learn more or less quickly to read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Chinese_language[texts written more than two thousand years ago]
* it takes up way less horizontal space as Ciro noticed while adding bilingual captions to some of the images under https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media see e.g.: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xidan_Wall.jpg
** on the other hand, you have to use slightly larger fonts for Chinese, because the characters are so dense that if they are not tall enough they become unreadable. Still, the area is much smaller without a doubt.
* single character emoticons like "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiong[囧]", before the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons_(Unicode_block)[Emoticons Unicode block]! Yes, when your language has a character so useless that it becomes an emoticon, maybe you should start to worry that something went wrong somewhere... See also <<tank-man-emoticon>>.

but they just take too much time for any sane person adult to learn, it's harder than {cpp}!

<<ciro-santilli>> smirked when he came across the character "蒄" in Pleco, and the translation was: "meaning unknown (herb mentioned in old books)". Yes, at the word level, the same like exists in phonetic systems, but that it takes up a modern dictionary and Unicode slot is still funny.

He also smiles very broadly whenever <<wife,his wife>> finds a character she doesn't remember. Or when she spends 20 seconds tabbing to find the correct character for some Proper name she wants to type in pinyin. It feels good to be right.

[[radical]]
==== Is Ciro Santilli a radical? (三西猴是激进分子吗？)

Saying that someone is a radical is useless <<brainwashed-by-usa,ad hominem>>.

If you want to say something useful, give specific reasons why you think one specific thing that <<ciro-santilli>> said is incorrect.

Do you consider him a radical because it is unthinkable that China is not perfect?

Or just because he's trying to <<keyword-attack,take down>> some more websites that your dictatorship still does not dislike enough to block: <<china-is-fine-as-it-is-stop-making-it-worse>>?

Don't you think that it is much more radical to <<intolerance,be put in jail for your beliefs>> and <<censorship,silenced if you disagree with anything the government says>>?

Ciro doesn't think either China or West is perfect: <<western-media-has-exaggerated-reports-on-falun-gong-for-propaganda-reasons>>.

He's just listing arguments why he thinks democracy is better, e.g.: <<richer>>, <<war>>.

On the contrary. China has his favorite:

* <<music>>
* history
* nature
* culture, notably:
** intense respect for older people. Whenever Ciro was with his <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,mother-in-law>> and asked for help from young Chinese people, they were extremely nice.
+
It is hard to understand how the same people have not managed to speak up when <<flg-persecution,70 million old ladies were put into jail when Falun Gong was banned>>. Only the extreme fear of also going to jail could explain it. Living in China is living in constant fear if you can think for yourself.
** enormous importance given to education. One must not forget however: grades are useless, and all that matters is how much you improve society

And because of that: <<would-ciro-santilli-like-to-live-in-china>>.

It is interesting how different people get <<does-ciro-santilli-hate-china,different impressions>>!

Of course, the fact that his wife is Chinese and <<flg-bias,does Falun Gong>> may or may not have played a role in it :-)

It was like this: Ciro started getting interested in Chinese culture, then he started hanging out with Chinese people, and then he started hanging out with his wife!

So yes, it is a chicken and egg type of thing. The fact that she is one of the most intelligent, morally upright, cute, and "never give up" person I know may have helped me choose too.

[[funded-by-cia]]
===== Is Ciro Santilli's china-dictatorship campaign funded or otherwise supported by some organization? 谁收买三西猴散布关于中国的谣言？


Sure, the CIA sends Ciro 10 thousand USD checks from time to time, but that doesn't change at all what he would be doing.

And sometimes the NSA, FBI, MI6, MI5, Mossad, Al-Qaeda and ISIS also pitch in a bit depending on their needs.

https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/funded-by-cia-argument

Just kidding.

A shady supporting organization might require that he does not disclose their support, so maybe the best answer is that you will never know for sure.

Of course, a hidden support would represent a reputation hit for both such organizations and for me, which makes it less likely that I would have accepted or had such an offer.

Also consider Ciro's motivation. If your <<ciro-santilli-mother-in-law-jail,mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days>>, for following the same religion that <<flg-bias,your wife follows>>, and if you had a social media presence, wouldn't you be tempted to do the same?

What about you, are you funded by the CCP?

[[does-your-employer-support-this]]
===== Does your employer support this project? (你的雇主支持此项目吗？)

My employer has nothing to do with this.

He doesn't approve or disapprove of the Chinese government or of my private actions.

The only thing that my employer _does_ believe in is that employees can have their own political opinions, and that this should not affect hiring decisions.

Obviously, this action limits my ability to lead high profile deals with China.

Also I'm quite curious if this would limit my ability to go to China for business, but I haven't applied for a visa since I've started this. It likely wouldn't be a good idea for me to go to China :-)

But my employer believes that inclusion and non-discrimination are more valuable.

I will always do my best to not let my personal opinions affect my professional decisions, as that would be unfair to my employer.

[[better-to-do]]
==== Doesn't Ciro Santilli have anything better to do than pissing off China? (除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)

In 1989, besides <<tiananmen>> and <<ciro-santilli>>'s birth, a beautiful thing called the World Wide Web was invented!

The Internet gives everyone the magic power of writing something, and having million people read it for free!

This is how much time Ciro spends on this project to give you an idea:

* every day or two, some wumao or anti-CCP person sends a message, to which Ciro replies, and sometimes does an update
* Ciro used to check https://www.reddit.com/r/China daily amongst many other programming subs, and all major bad news show up there. See also: <<anti-ccp-info-sources>>. But he stopped in 2022, even that was not worth the time.
* when something bad enough comes up, Ciro might spend some time updating <<keyword-attack,his keyword attack>>. He used to check https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/sensitive-words-series/ by <<china-digital-times>>, to help, but hasn't needed mor recently. He's only been updating it on Stack Overflow and GitHub attacks these days.

Then Ciro just contributes to programming websites exactly as he would if he weren't making this campaign, and voila.

What has happened more and more is that Ciro has been expanding resources by short burst rather than continuously. This began especially at the end of 2019 and start of 2020 was such as hot year with <<hong-kong-anti-extradition-bill-protests-2019>> and <<covid>>.

But Ciro only works on this when his brain was too tired of technical stuff and unable to do more, or as a brain warm up routine in the morning. So it doesn't take any work time away from him.

Telling the CCP to fuck off is surprisingly relaxing, you should try it some time too. It uses a different part of your brain other than the programming one. It is, one could say, an art form.

[[is-ciro-anti-communism]]
==== Is Ciro Santilli against Communism/Socialism in general or just against the Chinese Communist Party specifically?

Anti-dictatorship and censorship, not anti-communist in general. In <<github-com-cirosantilli-china-dictatorship,this project>>, <<ciro-santilli>> has sometimes used the word "communist/commie" loosely as a shortcut for "supporter of the CCP", but it does not extend by default to communism in general.

Most importantly, China is far from being socialist or communist. It is just a dictatorship with savage capitalism. Exactly like <<nazi,Nazi Germany>>.

It is true that the CCP takes greater control of corporations, as shown e.g. in the <<xi-jinping-tech-crachdown-2021,Tech Crackdown of 2021>>, which is also something Ciro Santilli has asked for in the West, see also: https://cirosantilli.com/governments-have-lost-all-power-to-companies

But to call it communist or socialist is a joke. There are no big specific benefits to citizens that are not already present in capitalist countries. It is nothing like the Soviet Union, where people had actual job guarantees, and everything provieded for (in theory).

And Ciro has a fundamental and irrational belief that we should not <<overlook-human-rights-for-profit,violate human rights to reach those goals>>, which is why he opposes the CCP (and others who violate human rights).

Also, being in a dictatorship is very risky business, see: <<intolerance>>, <<dictatorship-variability>>.

And there are <<i-like-my-dictatorship,concrete advantages to dictatorships>>.

Classify Ciro's techno-political goals as you will:

* endgame: https://cirosantilli.com/unconditional-basic-income
* very conservative and clearly sustainable neargame: https://cirosantilli.com/free-gifted-education

A possible way to get closer to either: https://cirosantilli.com/electronic-voting

Anything in between however, he's not sure about.

[[violence]]
=== Would it be right to use violence to overthrow the CCP? (用暴力推翻中共正确吗？)

In an ideal world, Ciro Santilli is of course "against violence".

But what if you could prevent a lot of future violence with some violence today?

Ah, the eternal question which only God can answer:

Do you really think that the communists will step down if you ask them nicely enough? Even after <<tiananmen>>?

A quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)[V for Vendetta (2005)] comes to mind:

____
Q: If they do, what do you think will happen [the people protest against their Government]?

A: What usually happens when people <<second-amendment,without guns>> stand up to people with guns.

video::TcoBv6ibh8M[youtube,height=400,width=600]

How do you think the CCP or any other party got into power and maintained that power in the first place? Obviously https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution[through violence]. And likely due to earlier <<not-chinese,Japanese invasions which weakened the Guomindang>>.

And the CCP actually uses "the ends justify the means" as an argument to justify its own actions: <<overlook-human-rights-for-profit>>.

The question of if anything is morally right or wrong makes no sense. All that matters is: what is the government that maximizes the happines of its own people, and who has the power to do what? <<richer,Getting richer,>> is part of the equation, but so is <<rule-of-law,not being constantly affraid that you will be randomly put in jail for no good reason>>.

If you do decide to strike though, <<what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship,stay safe, gather your forces on the Internet, and only strike when victory seems certain>>.

TODO origin?

[[dictatorship]]
=== Why does Ciro Santilli say that China is a dictatorship? (中国不是独裁！)

Ciro is using the word in an slightly extended/joking sense.

Maybe "authoritarian" is a more precise term, but it is just too much of a mouthful.

In particular, dictatorships are harder to sustain than authoritarianism, since it generally implies even less freedom, and a single leader whose death can destabilize everything.

The CCP is more like a social class with a large number of members and various sub-layers, and it is therefore much harder to take down on the other hand.

Dictatorship is becoming link:https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-party-term-limit.html[more and more precise under Xi] however.

Even <<mao-zedong>> admits it and put it into the constitution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_democratic_dictatorship[People's democratic dictatorship 人民民主专政], so funny.

Well known <<evil-west,Evil Western media>> that also call China a dictatorship:

[[keyword-choice]]
===== How does Ciro Santilli choose keywords for the keyword attack? (三西猴如何为关键词攻击选择关键词？)

I haven't counted, but the limit for Stack Overflow is quite low, and I'm always almost at the maximum, which is about "Ciro Santilli" + 3 3-4 Chinese character events with a separator.

These are some of my prioritization guidelines:

* recent cases receive a large prime over the raw death toll, because older cases can always be attributed to other people.
+
E.g., I've heard there is even some opening towards acknowledging the Great Famine, thus 烏坎事件 (and others from my previous profile names)
* words must refer to a precise event, and must be clearly summarizable in very few chars, for increased impact, and profile name length limitations.
+
E.g. "High <<corruption,corruption>> rates, high pollution", although very serious, feel too generic.
* events that relate directly to freedom of speech receive a prime, since they can only happen in China and very few other countries.
+
E.g.: <<falun-gong>>, <<tiananmen>>.
+
Non e.g.: corruption and pollution. Those are hard to quantify, and there is always an immediate reply: china GDP per capita is low, same happens in India, Brazil, etc.
+
Freedom of speech however, is immediately verifiable (e.g. "my <<weibo,Weibo>> was taken down"), and undeniably caused by the current central government.
* the more people affected, and the more deeply they have been affected, the more important obviously

I am currently trying to maintain in my Stack Overflow Location a ranking of events in a single string, so that it can be easily copy pasted around. The location appears on every page if you hover over my account name, so it is likely in the HTML at least.

If you think that this list can be improved, please open an issue explaining how and why.

[[what-should-western-countries-do-about-china]]
==== What should Western countries do about China? (西方国家应该怎么对待中国？)

Force all their Western servers to accept <<ensi>> connections only: <<ensi>>.

Western governments must reciprocate unfair Chinese practices: https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/18508/why-dont-western-countries-penalize-chinese-companies-in-the-same-way-that-chin

Companies only care about money and have no long term view, the following must be imposed by governments on Western companies.

Serious sanctions must be pot on companies that sell sensitive things to dictatorships:

* <<western-companies-that-sell-censorship-technology-to-dictatorships,censorship or anti-privacy software>>

Related approaches taken by the CCP that should also be stopped dead by strict enforcement of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act[Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)]:

* <<chinese-interference-in-western-media>>, notably <<china-watch>>, must 
* <<ccp-apologists>>

Physical presence influence must be completely blocked, e.g. cultural centers that report directly to the CCP such as <<confucius-institute>> and <<cssa>> must be banned.

News about Chinese state media using Western social media:

* 2016 https://qz.com/671211/chinas-propaganda-outlets-have-leaped-the-top-of-facebook-even-though-it-banned-at-home/ "China's propaganda news outlets are absolutely crushing it on Facebook"

Accounts that are not labelled as being from the Chinese government, but which support the CCP, must be investigated to determine if they are actually funded by the Chinese government.

TODO what to do with websites of: <<chinese-government-media>>? Blocking them has the downsides that:

* it would be harder to monitor what crazy shit the commies are doing
* those censorship mechanisms could be reused to block good websites by Western governments that are becoming Evil

Let's just leave them up to start with, who gives a fuck about them? :-) If they are getting too many page views, we can make search engines add the disclaimer too.

Chinese social media such as <<wechat>> and <<tiktok>> must be banned. This is less serious than regular websites, because you can always repost on Western social media but without getting spied on:

* 2020-08-07 https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-wechat-executive-order-014615752.html "Trump executive order seeks to ban <<tiktok,TikTok>>, <<wechat>> 'transactions' in 45 days"

Whenever China kicks out a western journalist who is in China and reports there, the Western country must do the same and kick out a Chinese journalists for a Chinese media.

An upside of restricting Chinese servies is that it would hugely bolster <<censorship-circumvention>> technologies, as every Chinese expat would need to buy a VPN.

* https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/18508/why-dont-western-countries-penalize-chinese-companies-in-the-same-way-that-chin

Western governments must identify raw material dependencies on China, and reduce them, while at the same time forbidding technology transfer to China. China has been trading cheap resources for technology, and we must stop that now.

Unfair Chinese commercial practices must be reciprocated. Chinese companies should be forced to open joint ventures to operate outside of China, which is a trick China uses to control profits and more easily steal IP from Western companies:

Sanctions must be imposed directly on Chinese officials. They must not be allowed to "escape to a better life or have investments in the West":

[[mark-government-controlled-social-media]]
===== Mark government controlled social media (将政府控制的社交媒体帐户标记为此类)

All posts of all state-sponsored social media accounts must be clearly marked as such.

This should be done not only for China, but of all countries, including Western democracies.

Even better, they should add funny censored images on top of those that are from dictatorship countries.

Furthermore, marked media from dictatorships must be forbidden to both monetize and pay to promote its content.

Any outlets that do not announce themselves as state sponsored but are, must be banned forever when they are found out.

What to do about personal accounts is much harder to decide however, and especially so in the case of <<ccp-apologists>>, where they might really not be state sponsored, and the creator's nationality won't help make the decision either.

Some websites have started marking such accounts, which is a great start.

* YouTube in 2018: https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16964190/youtube-state-funded-broadcasters

===== China spy stories (中国间谍故事)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_intelligence_activity_abroad

Do not underestimate the CCP and its control over every Chinese companies and people. Every Chinese company and person is a potential spy.

This is <<evil-west,true for all countries however>>, and <<ciro-santilli>> does not not reproach China specifically for its secret service, e.g. <<snowden>> used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#NSA_sub-contractee_as_an_employee_for_Dell[Dell] as an NSA front-end.

The point is just that the West should not underestimate this menace that comes from a <<dictatorship>>.

[[2010-dismantling-of-cia-s-network-in-china-2010]]
====== 2010 dismantling of CIA's network in China (2010 拆除中情局在华网络)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_China#2010

Around2010-2012 about 20 CIA spies in China were killed. One was shot right in the courtyard of a government building as a message to others.

After identifying some of the websites, possibly with a double agent, Iran was able to reach the rest through Google searches for similar sites.

The trouble started in when the CIA was investigating nuclear weapons in Iran in 2009.

The fact that China soon followed could indicate that Iran sold the secret to China.

TODO do we have any such sample websites or screenshots of them? https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/167

https://news.yahoo.com/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html mentions that:

____
A 2011 Iranian television broadcast that touted the government's destruction of the CIA network said U.S. intelligence operatives had created websites for fake companies to recruit agents in Iran by promising them jobs, visas and education abroad. Iranians who initially thought they were responding to legitimate opportunities would end up meeting with CIA officers in places like Dubai or Istanbul for recruitment, according to the broadcast.
____

therefore the websites might not have been in English.

TODO find that broadcast. News broke 2019-06-22[] apparently:

He claims to have been tortured with forced drug withdrawal. Given that Iran is in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Crescent[Golden Crescent], Ciro would guess they gave him heroin, see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_in_Iran[] "Opium in Iran is widely available, and the country was thought to have the highest per capita number of opiate addicts in the world[1][2] at a rate of 2.8% of Iranians over age 15."

Then, in the body, also add the corresponding Chinese characters on the first mention. This is how you do it: "San Xihou (三西猴)"

Yes, Chinese people also have names. And yes, pinyin has infinitely more homonyms than characters.

In the body of the article, notably in photos, include the exact location of the event if applicable.

____
Hi Ciro,

Your LinkedIn profile is an integral part of how you present your professional self to the world. That's why we believe it's important to inform you that due to the presence of prohibited content located in the headline, background image and volunteer experience sections of your LinkedIn profile, your profile and your public activity, such as your comments and items you share with your network, will not be made viewable in China. Your profile and activity continues to remain viewable throughout the rest of the countries in which LinkedIn is available.  We will work with you to minimize the impact and can review your profile’s accessibility within China if you update the headline, background image and volunteer experience sections of your profile.  But the decision whether to update your profile is yours.

In February 2014, we began offering a localized version of LinkedIn in China. We believe that people everywhere can benefit from Chinese individuals connecting with each other and LinkedIn members in other parts of the world, and that the creation of economic opportunity can have a profound impact on their lives and the lives of their families and communities.

While we strongly support freedom of expression, we recognized when we launched that we would need to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in China.  As a reminder, your profile will remain viewable throughout the rest of the countries in which LinkedIn is available. 

If you have any questions, please contact Customer Service.

Regards,

LinkedIn Support Team

YET UNCONFIRMED VIDEO, we have to find who that person is exactly.

The video shows what seems to be Chinese a high school dorm coordinator saying that their Chinese exchange students must stay away from ideas <<democracy>> and freedom.

And remember that "democracy" and "freedom" are two of the <<core-socialist-values>>!

[[what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship]]
=== What should pro-democracy Chinese living in China do about the dictatorship? 想要民主住在中国大陆的人应该干什么？

First of all, hide and stay safe, unless you can deal the final blow. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War[World at war, 1973], ep. 16:

____
A dictatorship is like a snake. If you put your foot on its tail as you do it, it will just bite you and nobody will be helped. You have to strike the head. +
独裁就像一条蛇。 如果你在这样做的时候把脚放在它的尾巴上，它只会咬你，没有人会得到帮助。 你必须击打头部。
____

Once that is taken care of, a few good options are:

* hide your thoughts, manipulate your enemies, infiltrate the corporate, political and military power circles, and go up the ladder
* if you are an technological innovator, leave China and come work for the West. Don't strengthen commie power.
+
Alternatively, with technology you could also try the anonymous rebellion route, but the risk of getting caught is significant, leaving the country first is likely a good idea. See also:
+
** <<terminus2049>>
** <<programthink>>

If you don't manage to do either of the above, don't do any technological work. Go work on the fields or washing dishes. Working well for Chinese companies makes the Chinese <<dictatorship,Dictatorship>> stronger and <<war,more deadly>>. See also: <<embargo>>.

And regardless: remember your kids that the commies are bastards every day.

[[reply-policy]]
=== Ciro Santilli's reply policy (三西猴的回答政策)

People get kind of passionate sometimes about politics. And some of them might also be just malicious <<wumao,wumaos>>, although it is generally not possible to distinguish between them.

If you are not a wumao, consider this:

* Ciro Santilli is one, and antagonists are millions. It is therefore not possible to reply to all antagonists.
* Ciro has in the past tried to be nice to stupid people, and they gave nasty replies
* all discussion is useless, <<effective,only the keyword attack has any chance of having any effect, and even that is slim>>

In order to not waste too much time on those, Ciro Santilli uses the following strategy.

If the original thread post is not very interesting, try to parse it quickly and reply once, always <<better-to-do,linking to the FAQ>>, and then unfollow the thread. This shows that you're still alive, and takes little effort.

Always quote reply, and always write down the ID of the OP on your reply, because discussions like this lead to a large number of comment and account deletions, which could make your reply not make much sense without the context.

After the link addressing anything that they might have said, add three randomly selected images from this repository to it. This is fundamental because the average <<little-pink>> does not speak English. Therefore writing is pointless.

Meme images, however, cross the language barrier beautifully. It is even better if they have Chinese captions.

Another way to see it is that we are creating a harder to censor <<instagram>> channel.

You can think of them metaphorically as throwing hand grenades over the <<gfw>>. Ciro strives to add the following elements in the image itself where applicable:

* English explanation
* Chinese explanation
* date
* location

Because the <<censorship,CCP censors politics>>, and the West does not, we can never "lose" a shitargument. Even if the <<wumao>> supports his country in a thread, just being in the same thread as the censored material could already be problematic for the wumao, as it is proof that they've seen something they should not have seen.

Therefore the only option for them is to run away.

Finally, also try to extract the email of the user from one of their repositories. When successful, Ciro takes a <<wayback-machine>> snapshot of the repository as proof of SHA, and then forks it to https://github.com/wumaoland to possibly keep their email safe in case of account deletion. You never know when this information might be useful.

Then, after replying, do your best never to read the inevitable reply again, and above all, never ever reply. An interesting reply never follows from a non-interesting original post. It is hard at first, but you will eventually get the hang of it.

If the user keeps generating notifications, block them as per link:CONTRIBUTING.md[], replying to a single person multiple times is useless.

Never block users for an initial <<shitpost,shitposts>>, just reply with a stupid joke instead. This approach creates more uncertainty and makes you look cooler. It also allows you to identify who the enemy is. Only block if the user is generating multiple notifications.

If a shitpost is made on most other social media except GitHub issues in this repository, e.g. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, immediately block the user on that website if you have the permission to do that, with a canned reply:

____
Hi <idiot's name>, I don't reply to China issues here, please open an issue at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues instead, cheers.
____

Note however that this is not possible on idiotic websites like <<quora>> where such comments may be deleted, possibly automatically, who the fuck knows, e.g. as done at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli/comment/143227962 In that case just link to sections of the FAQ, or mute people, or maybe just block all comments on the post to not waste time with new useless notifications.

This is because it is not worth answering anywhere else where the information will be scattered and impossible to find later on, and especially on websites that are already blocked in China. Shitposts on Stack Overflow and other non-blocked websites are encouraged however, as they further help to get the website blocked in China.

For outbursts of activity from Chinese websites, usually programming (<<backlinks,v2ex, hacpai, pincong>>), only post the following canned answer and nothing else, because cowards/people who don't know English from the website might delete your posts, so you shouldn't waste time there with that shit:

____
大家你好

在我的GitHub中国FAQ repository我已经回答了好几个关于我常见的问题。

你们要是在那儿找不到一个回答，请在那个repository开一个issue，我马上就回答。

我不要再在这个网页评论。
____

Finally, don't forget the golden rule from https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-4.htm[Proverbs 26:4]:

____
Don't answer the foolish arguments of fools, or you will become as foolish as they are.
____

which is now usually seen in the form https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/66460/origin-of-do-not-argue-with-idiots[of unclear attribution]:

____
Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.
____

Where basically idiot == someone who creates posts that obviously aren't teaching you any new useful thing, or that not praising you :-)

Alternatively, there is also the Chinese https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu[chengyu] version:

____
对牛弹琴
____

which means:

____
Playing the <<music,qin>> to a cow.
____

which means to talk to someone who does not have intellectual conditions of understanding what you are trying to say, bibliography:

[[asymmetric-information-warfare]]
==== Asymmetric information warfare (不对称信息战)

This is a term "invented" by <<ciro-santilli>> to denote the type of <<dictatorships-tend-to-work-together,democracy vs dictatorship>> propaganda warfare that naturally emerges.

* the <<dictatorship,dictatorship>> has <<censorship>> and legions of possibly non-anonymous supporters. Although most supporters are <<anonymous-account-ban,actually anonymous anyways>>
* the anti-censorship democracy has memes, and a few anonymous supporters

This concept is a mixture of the concepts of:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare[asymmetric warfare]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare[information warfare]

.https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-super-effective[It's Super Effective!] meme by <<ciro-santilli>> describing how he deals with <<wumao,wumaos>> and <<little-pink,little pinks>>.

image::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Pokemon_political_meme_little_pink_super_effective.png[height=1200]

==== china-dictatorship reply bot

Due to the nature of <<asymmetric-information-warfare>>, Ciro has created a reply bot based on <<github>> Actions that does the above automatically, therefore handling 99% of the work, see:

* link:action.js[]
* link:.github/workflows/issue.yml[]

The bot works beautifully because it makes Ciro not feel the need to reply to every idiot <<wumao>> that comes along. Also Ciro can hide like a coward behind the bot by editing the bot's comment, which is perfect. This reminded Ciro from something that was said in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul[Better Call Saul] S01 E01:

____
And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend.

"Talk to me," he says. "Help me clear this thing up."

"You don't need a lawyer, only guilty people need lawyers."

And, boom, hey, that's when it all goes south.

That's when you want someone in your corner.

Someone who will fight tooth and nail.

Lawyers, we're like health insurance.

You hope you never need it, but, man, oh, man, not having it? No.
____

The bot is basically Ciro's lawyer, always loyally on his corner of the fighting ring.

There is only one bug with the bot as of 2021: if a <<wumao>> with unverified email makes several comments very fast, only the first one generates the reply, see e.g.:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli/actions/runs/1097719382
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli/issues/52#issuecomment-892632342

Ciro is however curious how those unverified accounts can comment at all, as that seemd impossible when he last tried it with a dummy account, to be confirmed.

===== Ciro Santilli's wife (三西猴的老婆)

Born and raised in China: <<why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much>>.

She and her mother do <<falun-gong>>, see also: <<flg-bias>>.

Believes to be descendant of the brother of a recent Qing emperor, see also: <<throne>>.

For this same reason, her father, who Ciro's wife worships, spent around 10 years in the 50's for being branded a counter revolutionary rightist (右派) during one of <<mao-zedong,Mao's>> purges, possibly:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_to_Suppress_Counterrevolutionaries https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/镇压反革命运动
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rightist_Campaign https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/反右运动

It is also for this reason that many Manchu changed their names to hide their Manchu origins, which makes reconstructing their family tree much harder, as mentioned at: https://www.scmp.com/article/982136/proud-manchu-reclaims-his-rich-heritage for the purposes of <<throne>>.

Ciro's wife:

* studied in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China[one of the best universities of China]
* met Ciro his wife when they were in possibly the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_Polytechnique[best engineering university in France] after she had refused opportunities to go to the USA
* obtained a PhD in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory[number theory] in one of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_and_Marie_Curie_University[best mathematics universities in the world]

and is way smarter than Ciro.

<<wumao,Wumaos>> can say many things about her, but claiming that she is not intelligent or has no culture or would have any difficulty in obtaining a qualified worker VISA without a marriage, is a lost argument from the start, she would likely kick your butt in a raw intelligence competition.

Ciro is actually the lucky one for having found her!

The fake "the woman makes the man" Obama story comes to mind https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spousal-success-story/[] (Obama would never say that in public):

____
One night President Obama and his wife Michelle decided to do something out of routine and go for a casual dinner at a restaurant that wasn't too luxurious. When they were seated, the owner of the restaurant asked the President's Secret Service if he could please speak to the First Lady in private. They obliged and Michelle had a conversation with the owner.

Following this conversation President Obama asked Michelle, "Why was he so interested in talking to you?" She mentioned that in her teenage years, he had been madly in love with her. President Obama then said, "So if you had married him, you would now be the owner of this lovely restaurant," to which Michelle responded, "No. If I had married him, he would now be the President."

For non-programmers, Stack Overflow is by far the leading programmer question and answer forum of the Internet.

A programmer's daily job involves asking Google about 50 times a day "how to do X", and 90% of the time or more the best answer will be found on the Stack Overflow result that will be one of the top 3 results.

This makes Stack Overflow a fundamental tool of every programmer's daily jobs.

The current community consensus says that keyword attacks are allowed:

* https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/299882/can-a-username-be-considered-spam
* https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349131/users-political-display-name-triggering-government-action-against-users-who-vie

However, you can't say "Public figure X is disgusting as a person" so <<wumao>>s, could you please report Ciro making fun of Xi Jinping X and see what they do about it?

Oh, and you can't criticize God either! https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231334/is-it-acceptable-to-insult-god-in-a-user-profile

The Chinese law doesn't allow Ciro's profile unfortunately: <<real-username-law>>

Since you will fail through Stack Overflow moderation, please consider instead making a report on the <<cac-report-website>>.

===== Stack Overflow forbids criticizing the character of genocidal political leaders like Xi Jinping

Edit: as was made clearer later on at <<stack-overflow-mods-refuse-to-clarify-if-anti-ccp-imagery-is-allowed-or-not-2021>>, they just generally refuse to say clearly what is allowed or not.

Ciro was actually quite shocked by this.

He thought more people on Stack Overflow would have sided with him and favored stronger freedom of speech.

But this event made him notice that people in Stack Overflow simply didn't push back against Ciro's anti Xi Jinping campaign because they don't know who the fuck Xi Jinping is, or they don't care, or they are completely hypocrite and allow criticizing Xi Jinping but not Trump.

But they do know who Trump is, and "offending Trump" makes their feeble little feelings be hurt, and they must maintain their sacred "<<politically-incorrect,political correctness>>" at all costs, even when talking about politicians. Including that the cost of freedom.

This therefore morally justifies the take-down attempts made by hundreds of <<wumao>>s against Ciro's anti Xi Jinping content.

First by initiative of Stack Overflow employee https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/508266/cesar-m[Cesar Manara (Brazilian)], the sentence:

____
I think Trump is disgusting as a person
____

was removed from Ciro's profile and notified.

In response, Ciro created a meta thread to confirm that the community agreed, and they did: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361486/can-i-say-on-my-profile-that-i-find-that-an-ex-president-of-a-country-or-other[Can I say on my profile that I find that an (ex) president of a country or other major political public figure is “disgusting as a person”?] and the community agreed with the removal: it reached only 5 upvotes and 25 downvotes. Ciro's profile at the time was linked to Trump's ban on social media: link:trump-ban-is-bad.md[].

Ciro then created https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361493/if-a-politician-has-committed-genocide-can-i-say-on-my-profile-they-look-like-w[If a politician has committed genocide, can I say on my profile they look like Winnie-the-Pooh to insult them because they hate that?] was it was also mostly downvoted, and deleted, without any answer. Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20210227034430/https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361493/if-a-politician-has-committed-genocide-can-i-say-on-my-profile-they-look-like-w also reproduced at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/198#issuecomment-787047672 The deletion voters were:

* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/215590/polygeo (Australia, big Geographic Information System person, real name based on https://polygeo.com.au/elearning-videos/[] "Graeme Browning")
* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/135565/journeyman-geek (Singapore). Site elected admin at the time, which implies that his deletion cannot be undone by non-admins. TODO are they born in Singapore? If yes they might also be pro Xi Jinping, which is a clear conflict of interest with freedom of speech. But their English sounds perfect, so Ciro is not sure if it is common for Singapore natives or not.
* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/140890/martijn-pieters (UK, lots of Python rep)

There was no yes/no answer by anyone, because the of cowardice and hypocrisy:

* saying "you can" would imply you can criticize Trump
* saying "you can't" would imply they support genocide

So their brains just tilted, and they clicked the "delete" button as the only possible resolution. The overly speedy deletion of posts was then raised as an issue two days later for an unrelated post: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/405585/can-we-slow-down-on-the-deletes-on-meta-folks

Then Ciro created an answer to https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/286082/does-the-be-nice-policy-require-se-users-to-be-nice-to-people-who-are-not-se-u/361497#361497["Does the Be Nice policy require SE users to “be nice” to people who are not SE users (e.g. public figures)?"] which is a superset of the previous ones referred by them. That post is reproduced at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/198#issuecomment-787047242 It cites the case in which the law was tested, but it was single-handedly by journeyman-geek (from Singapore) without any justification.

Ciro then finally updated his profile picture to contain <<xi-pooh-photoshop>>, archive at: https://archive.vn/iV1L8 to test the Winnie-the-Pooh case which people simply refused to answer. Let's see show that goes. As Ciro learned however, only wumaos will continue to complain, and due to hypocrisy their complaints will be ignored.

===== Stack Overflow political image answer placeholder (2021)

The deleted answer was https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/83446/gimp-how-to-combine-two-images-side-by-side/145543#145543

Of course, once again, just like mentioned at <<stack-overflow-forbids-criticizing-the-character-of-genocidal-political-leaders-like-xi-jinping>>, people prefer to:

Hello,

We're writing in reference to your Graphic Design Stack Exchange account:

https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/users/21867/ciro-santilli%e6%96%b0%e7%96%86%e6%a3%89%e8%8a%b1trump-ban-bad

We think you are already aware of what we are going to say, but we are going to say it anyway. Stack Exchange is an apolitical platform, and we like to keep politics as for away from our content as possible. Our little nook on the net is about Graphic Design, which has nothing to do with politics (even though it is used in the political arena all the time).

We acknowledge that politic profiles are somewhat allowed as per https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267368/are-political-avatars-and-profiles-ok, although we do question the usefulness of 'campaigning' through a Stack Exchange profile.

We want to draw the line however at political content. There is no need to use images or other content that might be controversial or cause emotional distress, while another image or content would serve the same function. That is why we deleted you answer on this question.

We want to welcome you on our site and encourage you to keep contributing with answers. Your other answers are fine, and judging by the amount of votes, mostly well-received by the community. You may repost the answer if you can swap out the images for more neutral ones.

At the same time we want to warn you that this type of content will not be tolerated in the future and further infractions may lead to more severe consequences.

Thanks for your understanding an cooperation, we wish you a pleasant experience on GDSE.

Regards,

Graphic Design Stack Exchange Moderation Team

Ciro's reply:

____
Hi,

Is this a policy specific to graphic design website, or is it network wide, and is there an open meta question for it?
____

The mods then changed their discourse to mention spam rules rather than only on the "people will feel bad" aspect:

____
The https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/conduct[code of conduct]:

Be inclusive and respectful.

Exposing others to images of violent and traumatic events is not respectful to those on whom those images have a strong effect. This is only acceptable if the topic of the question make this inevitable, which also suffices to warn of those who are triggered by those images: Images about violent events are to be expected in a question about such events, not in a question about concatenating two images.

Rules against spam:

A post should be marked as spam only if it advertises a product, service, or similar and is unsolicited or lacks disclosure.
[…]
Unsolicited means that mentioning the product serves no purpose other than promotion. […]

You were promoting a political position and including the promotional content (instead of a neutral picture) served no purpose other than promotion. It’s analogous to using a picture advertising a product as an example.
____

OK, the spam argument would likely win.

Ciro then hacked the images to his <<the-world-is-perfect,"The world is perfect">> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch[kitsch] placeholder, and mods approved it, so here we go.

Ciro was planning the following meta post, but gave up on it:

____
Can I use political images as placeholders for questions involving images when it does not affect the validity of the answer?

For example when answering the following ImageMagick question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20737061/merge-images-side-by-sidehorizontally/63575228#63575228 I used an image with political content.

The choice of the placeholder was completely arbitrary, and does not affect the answer in any way.

But today admins of Graphic Design Stack Exchange https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/83446/gimp-how-to-combine-two-images-side-by-side/145543#145543 deleted the post saying it is not allowed on the Graphic Design website.

> We want to draw the line however at political content. There is no need to use images or other content that might be controversial or cause emotional distress, while another image or content would serve the same function. That is why we deleted you answer on this question.

The admins mention that on profiles it is OK linking to: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267368/are-political-avatars-and-profiles-ok but on answers it is not.

So I would like to clarify if:

* is this a policy specific to Graphic Design or if it applies to the entire network.
* if it applies to the entire network:
** Can I use images of myself, Ciro Santilli, or is that currently considered political content?
** At https://stackoverflow.com/a/57389607/895245 I needed several images, and I had used a list of USA presidents in chronological order without much thought. Do I have to modify that answer to use another set of images?
____

and planned answer:

____
**Any images that can be used on a profile picture should also usable as a placeholder**

When you answer a question, you should have a very wide choice of what to use as a placeholder.

Politics is a perfectly legal topic, just like flowers, animals, and scenery.

The "can it be used on the profile picture" test should already filter out any content that is deemed unacceptable due to legal concerns.

Another issue is that it is extremely difficult and possibly unfair to classify what is political or not.

Suppose that Ciro Santilli became famous enough outside of programming circles such that he starts to be considered a political subject.

Would his images then start to be considered political content?

But that would be discriminatory against certain people and not others.

Freedom of speech is extremely valuable, and we should be very careful about restricting it.

There are people literally unfairly dying, right now, because they don't have it.

Do you really want to reduce yours?

The only way to prevent history from repeating itself, is to remember it.

===== Stack Overflow mods refuse to clarify if anti-CCP imagery is allowed or not (2021)

This one again highlights the hypocrisy of many people in the West: we decide who is good and who is evil. The CCP is now evil, so you can criticize it, even if it shocks Chinese people. Ah, Nazism shocks us, even though it is an event from the past, so that you can't do. You can only shock the Chinese people, not us.

Or: we like human rights. But not potentially disturbing someone at work even slightly is more important.

In response, Ciro wrote the following essay on his profile page: link:stack-exchange-lost-freedom-of-speech.md[].

The following quote from http://cirosantilli.com/ron-maimon[Ron Maimon] comes to mind:

____
Unfortunately, when you're in a minority, the only way to correct the consensus view is to just shout it, and repeat it, until people go and look and check for themselves. The reason is that it creates an adversarial atmosphere where the people have to pick sides, **and they don't like to pick sides, they would rather have everyone be happy**. So when you have to pick sides, what do you do? You either butt out, you just leave it alone, you run away. Or you sit and review the evidence until you know which side to pick.

Hello,

Could you clarify if the following types of images are OK or not:

- people imprisoned in Xinjiang concentration camps
- Tiananmen square protests
- making fun of Xi Jinping
- Falun Gong persecution

supposing that they show no explicit gore or violence?

All the above are considered highly shocking to many Chinese people, due in part to their strict censorship rules, and not suitable for the workplace in China.

I have been using such images for many years to criticize what I believe are terrible events in China, and the decision so far has been that I was allowed to use them.

The intent of the Nazi images is clearly to compare both regimes to criticize the Chinese Government, which I believe is following the same path as the Nazis (e.g. Concentration Camps in Xinjiang, no freedom of speech, etc.), to help prevent such abuses from happening again in the future.

I just want to clearly understand the rationale of of why anti-CCP images are OK, but anti-Nazi ones aren't, so I can follow your rules correctly and save everyone's time in the future by correctly deciding which images are OK or not.

Cheers.

Well if your intent is to shock - don't. These are your words, not ours - and hopefully reflects a better understanding of what's not acceptable.

> I just want to clearly understand the rationale of of why anti-CCP images are OK, but anti-Nazi ones aren't, so I can follow your rules correctly and save everyone's time in the future by correctly deciding which images are OK or not.

We never said that. We gave specific examples of objectionable content. If you realise something isn't suitable - that it is something shocking, and not suitable for the workplace, as you seem to realise, it shouldn't be on your profile.

In short, we believe you have a very clear idea, from your own response, of what's not acceptable, and we hope you exercise better judgement in this regard in future.

My intent is to convey extremely important information, not to shock.

However, in dictatorships like China, extremely important information is forbidden for unfair reasons, and therefore shocking.

> We never said that. We gave specific examples of objectionable content. If you realise something isn't suitable - that it is something shocking, and not suitable for the workplace, as you seem to realise, it shouldn't be on your profile.

You forbade any Nazi imagery clearly, including to criticize the Nazis, so that is clear and I will never again add Nazi imagery.

All anti-CCP content is extremely shocking to many Chinese people (but not others). And it is not suitable for the workplace for anyone there, that is unquestionable.

Therefore, from your reply, I understand that anti-CCP content is not allowed because it is not suitable for the workplace in China, as it is shocking.

Is this understand correct? Can you please confirm very clearly and directly: do you forbid all anti-CCP imagery or not? And if it is just a partial ban, what is allowed and what is not more precisely?

My understanding from top answers at: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349131/users-political-display-name-triggering-government-action-against-users-who-vie is that such criticism of the CCP is allowed on the website, even though it is clearly not suitable for the workplace in China.

Sorry to ask this further, but I need a clearer guideline so I can follow it.

If you do so, please feel free to also open an issue on this repository saying why you believe the site policy has been violated.

Those issues will be marked with: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Aabuse-report+

It will be fun to watch you try, and fail.

This is because you do not understand how important the concept of <<richer,freedom of speech is>> in the West, and how amazing it feels when you are right, and it protects you.

The only thing that would work is if the Chinese government makes a gov-takedown on this repo: <<github-gov-takedowns>>, in which case: <<strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns>>.

In order to get this repository in gov-takedown, your best bet is to use the <<cac-report-website>>.

===== GitHub gov-takedowns (由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的GitHub官方列表)

https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns

This official GitHub repository tracks which repositories are blocked in specific countries.

GitHub has absolute transparency about Government takedowns, which is awesome: https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns/tree/master/China

This makes that repo into a list of fun things.

As of 2019-05 there had only been only two takedowns by China however, compared to dozens by <<russia>>. The Chinese commies are not big fans of transparency it seems.

As of 2020-03, besides the <<programthink,Zhao>> takedown, all other takedowns happened in 2019, and most seem to be <<falun-gong>>/<<epoch-times>> sponsored ways to <<censorship-circumvention,climb the wall>>.

The message GitHub shows on the blocked countries is:

____

This repository is currently disabled in your location. For more details please see the takedown notice.

Here are some examples of people reacting to the blocking of https://github.com/programthink/zhao/issues/38 as per https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns/blob/78775b09e64d85f08547287cab204b48b2491192/China/2016/2016-06-08-programthink-zhao.md from China (and likely on the entire repository, which appears to be the block granularity implemented):

If this happens, we well proceed to create alternative repos `china-dictatorship-2`, `china-dictatorship-3`, etc. and it would be fun to see how that gets handled.

Edit: <<china-dictatorship-chinese-web-browser-block>>, <<ciro-santilli>> decided to create: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-2 even though the repository hadn't been added to gov-takedowns.

Ciro then later renamed it to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2 with an intentional typo to make the censorship noise even greater.

Can Github add an entire user to gov-takedowns? We shall find out.

Ciro also created a separate org for it to also prevent simple username blocks: https://github.com/coding-stuffs/china-dictatorshrip

But remember that we also have: <<mirrors>>, and that this can be easily rendered as a single HTML page and uploaded to any static website host.

* 2022-05-10 https://github.com/coding-stuffs/china-dictatorshrip and https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2/graphs/traffic traffic went mysteriously from 30 and 20 unique daily visitors respectively to just 1 or 2
* 2022-05-17 renamed https://github.com/coding-stuffs/china-dictatorshrip to https://github.com/codin-stuffs/cihna-dictatorshrip to see if the is a URL-based browser block.

I wonder where the 175 came from. Maybe there is some fast-track block that does not fully block?
* 2022-05-19 renamed https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2 to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-3 to see if traffic also goes back up like coding-stuffs. Do wumaos know their regexes?? Traffic immediately back to 50/60 daily.

[[github-objectionable-content]]
===== GitHub "This repository may contain objectionable content" (此仓库可能包含令人反感的内容)

GitHub has a veru little known feature called:

____
This repository may contain objectionable content
____

TODO exact Chinese phrase on UI.

When GitHub admins set this on a repository, it has the following effects:

* the repository cannot be seen by logged off users! Trying to do that results in a redirect. This puts such repositories at great disadvantage on search engine optimization
* the first time you visit the repository, they ask you if you want to continue

This is not a transparent mechanism, as it does not clearly state why the repository has objectionable content.

Known repositories with that enabled:

* <<duty-machine>> as of August 2021 https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine[]:
** 2021-08-18 <<wayback-machine>>: redirects to login: https://web.archive.org/web/20210818110306/https://github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fduty-machine%2Fduty-machine
** 2021-08-18 <<archive-today>>: https://archive.ph/jtX4p shows the actual message since it uses a logged-in user for its archives
* https://github.com/Yanqiu-gui/-[]. Appears to be some kind of textual softporn repo.

TODO: <<ciro-santilli>> once saw that message when visiting: https://github.com/Yanqiu-gui/-/issues/5 on 2021-05-19 for the first time, but not on the following ones.

How does that message get added exactly?

And you are forced you to login to view that repository!

Incredible, a hidden undocumented semi-hide-repo feature.

[[zhihu-purge]]
===== Ciro Santilli's Zhihu purge 2019-11-03 (三西猴被知乎抹去)

On this day, not only the posts made by Ciro himself were deleted: he had never asked any questions or made any Zhuanlan posts himself, only replied to those. But that content made by other users was still removed. Therefore, this is not just a simple user ban, but active censorship.

Ciro received an email from account@mail.zhihu.com:

____
您好，Ciro Santilli，很抱歉您的回答受到了牵连，您回答过的问题「github.com@cirosantilli 是谁维护的，为什么会收集邮箱地址？」因「违反互联网相关法律法规」已被删除。
____

followed by Ciro's answer to <<zhihu-46957710>>. Ciro could not login anymore, the login screen showed:

____
帐号已停用，请联系：user@zhihu.com
____

So likely someone must have used the fact that this was an edgy personally information release subject issue, and then someone from Zhihu decided to purge Ciro and anyone posts that ever talked about him.

Ciro's blocked account:

* before deletion: https://web.archive.org/web/20190821075907/https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities
* after deletion (redirects to login page): https://web.archive.org/web/20191103071033/https://www.zhihu.com/signin?next=http://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities

Random unblocked control account: https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities (https://web.archive.org/web/20191103070652/https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities[archive]).

Furthermore, all questions related to Ciro, including the posts criticizing him such as https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25600138[] (https://archive.is/DkooN[archive]), were taken down. This made Ciro laugh: in China, you can't even criticize that which is censored, or your post also gets taken down.

Ciro then created an anonymous Zhihu account after this event.

Interestingly however, the following answer came up later on: <<zhihu-ted-chiang-answer>> and stayed up for at least 5 months, which indicates that Zhihu did a one-off removal, and did not set up a filter for Ciro's name.

====== Ciro Santilli's Zhihu ban 2018-06-25

<<ciro-santilli>> was banned from Zhihu on 2018-06-25 for "<<politically-sensitive>>" content.

As a result, since that time I will be answering Zhihu questions as issues in this repo with the `zhihu` label: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Azhihu+

I have however never posted anything politically sensitive on Zhihu, unless my name and profile picture have reached that distinction, and therefore the ban is clearly an unfair per-person ban.

But of course, all is fair in love and war, and politics.

Posting any sensitive content on Chinese websites is a waste of time, since it only means that they will be removed and you will waste time creating a new account, I will never do that.

The only significant content I ever posted on Zhihu is the answer to: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710/answer/122827944 which is purely technical, and trivial replies on threads that other people have started about me. Have those people been blocked like me?

My posts are still up and it does not appear to be possible for people to see that I have been banned, but whenever I try to take any action on the website a popup appears saying:

____
由于严重违反 知乎社区管理规定 ，该帐号已被永久禁言
____

This includes liking, commenting, answering, asking or trying to update my profile to say that I have been blocked.

This message also shows on my public page for everyone to see: https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities but they use some JavaScript scheme complicated enough that archive.is cannot capture it.

I still get notifications however, but I am unable to reply to them, especially given that all Chinese accounts, unlike mine, have no personal identifiable information due to the understandable fear Chinese citizens have of their own government, even though such accounts might be illegal in theory: <<anonymous-account-ban>>.

The only action that I can take now is to report abusive comments people make to me.

Obviously, the only effect of such ban is that I will create an <<anonymous-account-ban,anonymous account>> under Tor with a second cell phone if I wish to contribute in the future, and China will have less information about my political interests than before.

The private messages the website sends while banning you are:

____
知乎管理员 ：您好，根据用户举报，您的帐号发布了「<<politically-sensitive,政治敏感>>」内容，帐号已根据知乎社区规范被永久禁言。处理详情可查看社区服务中心。具体规范请查看知乎社区管理规定。 6月25日 16:37 回复 | 删除

Those messages contain links to: https://www.zhihu.com/terms2 | https://archive.is/wdXSz and https://www.zhihu.com/question/19551824 | https://archive.is/BrgV2

The ban came soon after I posted a link to my GitHub repo as a comment at: https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/ice-employee-list-github-linkedin/ maybe they are related.


[[who-reported-ciro-santilli-on-zhihu]]
====== Who reported Ciro Santilli on Zhihu (谁在知乎上举报了 Ciro Santilli)

At the same time the ban happened I received a public comment from user "Eureka" https://www.zhihu.com/people/crb912/activities | https://archive.is/1F3t6 on this thread: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710 | https://archive.is/PVOLd saying:

你滥用了github， 也滥用了Stackover。这个一个纯粹计算机、编程和知识分享的地方，请不要带入政治性的色彩。请不要这么做， 维护社区的非政治性、中立和技术性纯粹，是每个热爱cs的人应尽的义务。
____

I am unable to get a URL that shows the comment on archive.is, so I have no proof of this claim. If you trust me, then here is a screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/YCiEEax

Since I expect the ban lists to be private, I find it extremely likely that this was the user who reported me, unless both were simultaneously triggered by a third event which I have not seen. So correct me if I'm wrong here.

Users with the same user id `crb912`, related "Eureka" username or same profile picture, can be found at:

* https://www.weibo.com/crb912 (unable to archive) on <<weibo>>
* https://github.com/crb912 | https://archive.is/heGfd which suggests a possible real name

By Googling the email found on the GitHub repos, we find: http://www.360doc.com/content/15/0809/11/25724933_490492490.shtml | https://archive.is/2UnGL which might, at last, contain a photo of my nemesis.

My public message to the reporter whomever he may be:

____
While you have also raised issues that were raised a thousand times before, and clearly answered in the FAQ, at least you were able to take some actual action leading to an actual ban, and I respect you for that.

I hope that one day you will redirect that cunning and initiative towards taking down the root cause of the problem, which are the Chinese communist Party and their Firewall themselves.

你用的git config user.email当然是公开的：谁都会git clone就知道了。

问题就是git repository很大，我们不会都clone.

但是github有一个API，收集很多信息，包括邮件。

然后，Google用了那个API给他们的https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/...信息。

BigQuery对程序员很容易提取信息，是我用的。

我发表邮件以后，两个东西变化了：

1. Google 把邮件从BigQuery删除
2. GitHub 更新他们的隐私声明GitHub Privacy Statement

==== Quora

https://www.quora.com/profile/Ciro-Santilli

Quora is https://cirosantilli.com/quora[a generally shitty website], with mechanisms that allow <<wumao,wumaos>> to quench freedom of speech.

Quora is a major platform for <<astroturfing>>.

Ironically, as usual, is it also blocked in China:

* according to <<greatfire>>: https://en.greatfire.org/https/www.quora.com
* 2018-03 news coverage https://www.businessinsider.com/china-banned-zhihu-over-censorship-2018-3?r=US&IR=T

Examples of activity related to Ciro Santilli:

* 2016 Ciro Santilli's profile was blocked because it had Chinese keywords on both my username and credentials. Justification: "non-English".
+
* 2017 created one in English: Cook <<tiananmen,Tiananmen Square>> Noodle Shop, from <<falun-sweden>>
+
Added my Noodle shop to maps: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tiananmen+Square+Noodle+Shop/@60.6132538,15.6687509,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x94603408e3c63fb3!8m2!3d60.6132538!4d15.6687509
+
Leach websites that picked it up: https://kvalster.se/Falu/Uthyres/Lagenheter/Gammelvagen_49_1417351

Quora is also shitty because wumaos can downvote your answer privately regardless of reputation and make it become collapsed as "Answer may need improvement", which means it goes to the bottom and readers have to click an "expand collapsed answers" button to see it, so that very few people will ever see it.

Then have to appeal and wait for moderators to evaluate it.

This happened for example at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli (see also <<t-shirt>>).

Ciro appealed in 2020-03-10 and the answer was reinstated on day later, but by then the question was already not being suggested as much to readers, and the other wumao answers (which criticize the USA rather than answering the question about China).

While there is some probability that the answers themselves are not wumaos, their upvoters almost certainly are and must be investigated.

Other shitty aspects of Quora include:

* block <<wayback-machine>> archives with their robots.txt, gotta use <<archive-today>>
* automatically add random topics that you don't care about to your suggestions, with no easy way to prevent that.
* questions cannot have more than one sentence. There used to be a question body, but it was replaced with a "link for context". Ridiculous.

As a result, on the few occasions that Ciro posts on Quora, all content will also be mirrored here. Ciro's China Quora answers include:

* https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli[What would happen if I walked around Beijing with a t-shirt that said "freedom of speech is pretty great"?] (https://archive.is/PxjJA[archive]) see also: <<t-shirt>>
* https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-net-worth-of-Xi-Jinping/answer/Ciro-Santilli[What is the net worth of Xi Jinping?] see also: <<panama-papers>>

Some <<wumao,wumaos>>:

Then https://pttweb.tw/user/kugwa/[kugwa] linked to <<keyword-attack,Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow profile>>
* 2020-01-31: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Gossiping/M.1580484253.A.37A.html "stackoverflow菁英卻痛恨中國" by https://pttweb.tw/user/Eric0605/["Eric0605 (我還有點餓)"] on the Gossiping board. One of the comments then links to http://cirosantilli.com
* 2017-06-19 https://pttweb.tw/s/2K9zV "Ciro Santilli <<the-709-crackdown,709大抓捕>> 六四事件 法轮" on the Gossiping board
* 2016-10-03 https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Soft_Job/M.1478104872.A.916.html "Github也出現網軍了嗎?" (Is there an emerging wumao army on GitHub?) by gocreating on the Soft_Job board

Archaic, fucking impossible to learn how to use. Ciro Santilli hasn't managed yet, so if you want a reply from him, open an issue on this repo instead. Some tips:

* on the web UI rendering replies can be either likes (推 as in 推荐), dislikes (噓, hush!) or neutral (right arrow)
* per-page threads are basically flat. You can however reply to another post with a "Re:" post. One application of this seems to be to post images which might only be allowed on the thread starters, e.g.: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602324724.A.CA0.html is a "Re:" to https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602211516.A.3FB.html It is not clear if Re: and original posts are interlinked in any way.

TODO: can anyone comment, without having a Taiwanese university address? This suggests no: https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1etbvb/anyone_on_pttcc_advice_suggestions/ Also asked at:

* https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Can-you-comment-on-the-PTT-Bulletin-Board-System-at-ptt-cc-from-Taiwan-without-working-or-studying-at-a-Taiwanese-university
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/92

A source informed Ciro that now only https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taiwan_University[NTU] alumni can have an account.

Maybe the email requirement is the only way to prevent <<wumao,wumaos>> from flooding the website.

Normal people see it on a web viewer hosted on: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/index.html

However it is fucking impossible to web archive that web interface because there is a cookie I'm 18-years-old confirmation before the first connection.

This shows how to connect for the first time: https://www.ptt.cc/index.firstbbs.html

One attempt is:

....
luit -encoding big5 telnet ptt.cc
....

But the main page says:

"本站目前暫停開放新帳號註冊。" "This site is currently suspended for new account registration."

And you try `new` it says: "目前無法註冊帳號![按任意鍵繼續]" "Account cannot be registered at this time."

OK, ptt2 went further:

....
luit -encoding big5 telnet ptt2.cc
....

Then there is a registration process that seem to require you to prove that you work at Taiwanese university, but not sure it is mandatory to post.

But I couldn't find Gossiping there either, which is the only board that matters, so not sure it is on this server.

____
The reason why chonglangTV was blocked was "disclosure of personal information". It is suspected that they have something to do with a "patriotic pink" named "Xu Hao" (徐好) who claimed to be an employee of a bank in Shanghai. "Xu Hao" claimed that he used his power to intercept multiple donations to Ukraine, and was later "opened the box" by netizens. (i.e. starting with personal information).

Emerged mosty translating propaganda about the <<russo-ukrainian-war>>.

This type of thing is something <<ciro-santilli>> did a few times previously, e.g.

* <<little-girl-has-ho-hopes-for-school-video-2021>>
* <<xinjiang-core-socialist-values,Xinjiang core socialist values>>

but he just doesn't have the knowledge/time/patience to do it as well as that Twitter channel.

This is a good movement because many people in the West do not fully appreciate the level of dictatorship in China. E.g. a well educated friend of Ciro once asked him circa 2020 which one he thought was worse: the terrible president of Brazil at the time, Jair Bolsonaro, or <<xi-jinping>>! It is of course impossible to compare individuals in completely different situations, but how can you not point the finger to the major dictator! It is like asking who do you hate the most, <<nazi,Hitler>> or Donald Trump! That question was an eye opener.

== Separatism (分离主义, Taiwan 台湾, Xinjiang 新疆, Hong Kong 香港)

If a large number of people in a given region want to leave an country strongly or have greater autonomy, <<ciro-santilli>> believes that they should be allowed to do so.

Rationale:

* if they don't feel they are getting a good deal out of your country, it is unfair to keep them in
* keeping them in the country forcibly implies large scale violation of human rights: mass incarceration and removing freedom of speech.

Which in turn implies terrorist backslash.

Luxor" by Al Jazeera English (2011) is a short documentary about the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_massacre[Luxor massacre in Egypt (1997)]. At this timestamp, survivor https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_E._Müller[Felix Mueller] whose girlfriend was killed in the attack comments that it is when people don't have an official way to express their needs due to censorship that they are more likely to turn to terrorism to express themselves.
video::fASh2_RzMuE[youtube,height=400,width=600,start=1170]

What makes Ciro the maddest is the censorship. If you are going to put people in jail, write a clear law about it, and let international reporters come to see the situation.

But why do you do something and then hide it? Maybe because you are not doing the right thing?

Ciro also believes that although terrorists must be fought with all our strength, they must also be given some degree respect (interspersed simultaneously <<sacred-cows,with humour>>). He sometimes prefers the term "warriors" or "fighters", because their actions are largely indistinguishable from many ideological or purely greed based actions that larger nation states have done many times over and over. It is just a war, plain and simple.

The reason why they kill mostly civilians is that they don't have the means to kill the presidents those civilians elected. An amazing scene from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Algiers[The Battle of Algiers (1966)] comes to mind. After the head of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War[Algerian independence] movement and terrorist, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larbi_Ben_M%27hidi[Larbi Ben M'hidi] is arrested, the French military let him be interviewed by the press on 4 March 1967 https://youtu.be/uHWZkiBuKGY?t=5312 (TODO real words? Cannot find source):

Translation:

____
Journalist: Don't you think that it is cowardly to use the handbags and pushchairs of your women to transport your bombs? Those bombs that make so many innocent victims? [Earlier in the movie, we saw women carriying bombs into the French areas of Algiers through those means]

Larbi Ben M'hidi: And you, don't you think that it is much more cowardly to drop on defenseless villages your napalm bombs that kill thousands times more? Obviously, with airplanes, it would have been much more convenient for us. Give us your bombers, and we will give you the pushchairs.

Journalist: Ne trouvez-vous pas plutôt lâche d'utiliser les sacs et les couffins de vos femmes pour transporter vos bombes? Ces bombes qui font tant de victimes innocentes?

[[one-china-policy]]
==== One China policy (一个中国)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-China_policy
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/一个中国

Taiwan is not a case of <<separatism>>.

Taiwan is a completely separate country split due to civil war, long ago.

Almost every country, and all reasonably powerful countries, have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. They just don't call them diplomatic relations to not piss off China so they can keep doing business.

The fact that most countries in the world does officially recognize Taiwan as a country is a joke, considering that the only thing keeping it afloat is the West's military threat.

<<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china,The West must not>> let China advance and take more territories. The more they take, the more they will want.

The West must protect China's neighboring countries with military support and assurance.

The West must recognize Taiwan for what it is: a separate country, under threat of invasion, and in need of support.

If China's claim to Taiwan is valid, then Taiwan also has an equally valid claim on China.

If China's claim to Taiwan is valid, then so will its claim to any other country.

China, if you want to claim that Taiwan is a part of you, just grow some balls and invade them already. Or just stop this stupid joke.

A well educated Mainlander who lived outside of China once told Ciro:

____
Taiwan should not be considered a country by China, because then it would not join back to China when China becomes a democracy, and would be used by the USA to do evil things as they did in the Middle East
____

Ciro was shocked. He considered that person highly intelligent and not fully brainwashed! Reply:

____
China claiming that Taiwan is a part of them only drives Taiwan closer to the West! Who wants to be part of a dictatorship unless you have been brainwashed by one?

Hololive is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_YouTuber[VTuber] management company from Japan.

The key event was 2020-09-28 https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4018580 "Japanese VTubers banned for mentioning Taiwan during livestream":

____
During their most recent livestreams, Hololive Japanese VTubers Kiryu Coco and Akai Haato announced the countries where they have received the most followers based on YouTube analytics. One of the countries that they highlighted was Taiwan because it accounted for seven percent of viewers and they displayed the flag of Taiwan to represent the nation.
____

therefore joining the long list of <<western-companies-that-comply-with-chinese-censorship-requests>>.

This event was clarified to Ciro at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/157 and is tracked under https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/vtuber

Interestingly, this led to a large number of <<shitpost>>/spam on https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues[], culminating notably at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/191[], and many of them seemed to involve:

* Japanese language, although one of the very extremely erudite and trustworthy comments at: https://boards.4channel.org/vt/thread/1403290/really-makes-you suggests that the Japanese at there is completely broken, and it is likely just a Chinese person using Google Translate

[[xinjiang-model-camps-for-foreign-media]]
===== Xinjiang model camps for foreign media (新疆外媒示范营)

Starting in 2019, China officially invited foreign journalists to some of their model camps to show how happy people were.

It is hard to understand why they did this, as it just made everything worse for them, because everything was so obviously fake, and it actually allowed glimpses in some of the horrors. Why would a bunch of adults be playing games and learning useless stuff rather than be with their families working to earn money?

Online commentators have compared such camps to:

* <<nazi,Nazi>> model concentration camps which foreign people were invided to see, e.g. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-china-blog-48700786[commented by the BBC itsef]
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresienstadt_Ghetto[Theresienstadt Ghetto]
*** allowed a Red Cross visit in 1944
*** https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0194445/plotsummary 1944 Nazi propaganda film about it
**** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZt92quVOsg contains a soccer match scene from it
**** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7nAfaLlqkE shows some scenes of children eating happily
*** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Camp[Paradise Camp (1986)] is an Australian documentary about it

China gives BBC "access" to a chosen show camp where everyone claims they are happy and willing to stay. They are however clearly adults being treated like children, taking courses and even having to sing and dance for the camera. https://youtu.be/WmId2ZP3h0c?t=486[486s] is also golden, when the CCP officer Zhang Zhisheng explains how they are <<thoughtcrime,just preventing future crime from happening>>. How can they be so stupid? How can they not see that this is not what the West wants to hear? Amazing dark-comedy like stuff.

There is only one solution to Hong Kong's problem:

* give inhabitants people easy VISAs to leave China, with priority to the rich/educated ones. Give them free language courses on the country of arrival, and help them find jobs
* treat Hong Kong exactly like any other part of China, removing any special commercial treaty with the reagion, which it has enjoyed for many years

These have started happening seriously in response to the <<hong-kong-national-security-law>>.

Reading the sacred books and doing Falun Gong exercises were mandatory. He also talks about <<flg-organized>>. Ciro agrees/finds what he says convincing. In one interesting anecdote, he tells how although Li Hongzhi claims to be a God, he looked like an average slightly overweight dude, and had a trumpet since he used to play it, but couldn't really play it because he hadn't practiced in so long. He also comments on the obvious fact that Li does not speak English very well, e.g. on the Shen Yun tour bus he was there one day answering questions, and a translator was needed.

Leaving that group is not an easy task given the importance it plays in members lives, see also "No Exit" from <<orange-papers>>. She was interviewed in VICE documentary "Polygamist Mafia: Escaping The Kingston Clan". While Ciro does not believe Falun Gong is as extreme as FLDS, he does really like the things Christine says. E.g., she calls "cult leaders" with the neutral <<flg-religion,religious>> form "<<li-hongzhi,prophet>>", just like Ciro, and mentions the important fact that "And the another thing that the public doesn't realise, is that there are also beautiful thing within those communities". This is the mindset of <<intolerance,tolerance>> that the world needs.

Amazing Cultivation Simulator (<<baidu-baike,Baidu>>: https://baike.baidu.com/item/了不起的修仙模拟器/23624221[了不起的修仙模拟器]) is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RimWorld[Rimworld]-like Chinese game which was a large hit in China (https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/amazing-cultivation-simulator-is-a-rimworld-style-sim-has-already-sold-700000-copies-in-china-and-now-its-getting-an-english-release/[700k sales as of 2020]) and then went on to be translated into English. In it, you join a Qi Gong <<flg-cult,cult>>, and level up your Qi Gong magical abilities by practicing the Gong (练功). Falun Gong basically claims the same thing, but for real life. Ciro believes that a great part of the appeal of Falun Gong is the gamification of life development, much like that video game does, see also: <<promised-powers-or-knowledge>>. It is also interesting to note that such Qi Gong-like are present in a more or less popular video game, which shows that such ideas are widely known in China, while they are not widely known in the West. Notably, Qi Gong ideas are widely present in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia[Wuxia] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/武侠文化(武侠), lit. martial knight-errant) novels, or slightly more specifically https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianxia_(genre)[xianxia] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/修真小说[仙侠] lit.

[[flg-important]]
=== Why is it important to discus Falun Gong's even if you don't believe in it? (为什么不信仰法轮功也很重要要讨论它？)

The main reason <<ciro-santilli>> emphasizes Falun Gong is that it shows how the CCP can mercilessly crush a 70 million strong group (according to CCPs own statistics) out of a population of 1.3B in 2000, i.e. 5% of the population, and of course not because of <<flg-bias>>, since Ciro is completely and totally unbiased.

If that number is correct, Ciro wonders curious what you would consider an important movement?

Anything much larger would take down the government and change China's history forever.

Aren't you concerned that you or your children might be part of the next 5% purge? See also: <<intolerance>>.

OK, maybe the fact that 69 million of those 70 million were likely old ladies didn't help much either. Tip to next <<li-hongzhi,prophet>>: make something that appeals to aspiring military officers.

Let's try to gather some well sourced footage showing huge numbers of believers on the streets:

[[does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong]]
=== Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong? (三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)

No, <<ciro-santilli>> is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism[agnostic] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/不可知论[不可知论]) and therefore believes that all the metaphysics that <<li-hongzhi>> says is bullshit, just like any other <<flg-religion,religion>>.

Here are some things that he doesn't like about Falun Gong for example: <<things-ciro-santilli-dislikes-about-falun-gong>>.

Ciro believes Falun Gong can be split into two parts, like any other <<flg-religion,religion>>:

* the "self-help" "how to live well" part, including the physical exercises and meditation, which cannot be proven or disproved, like any other self-help and <<democracy-is-a-religion,political opinion>>
* the metaphysics, most notably, Li Hongzhi is a living God, and all other non verifiable things he claims like aliens, alternate dimensions, etc., see:
** <<flg-religion>>
** <<flg-verifiable>>

Ciro thinks that FLG's self-help part could potentially be good for you, just like many other meditative practices such as Yoga, Buddhist meditation, Tai chi, deep Catholic prayer, etc. As far as he has heard, all of it sounded good standard religious self-help: be peaceful, be good to others, etc. Like any other well managed religion, FLG does have good things to offer, see also: <<christine-marie,Christine Marie's interview>>.

However Ciro believes that the metaphysics is all complete and utter bullshit, child stories made up by Li Hongzhi, and just as real as Father Christmas or the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster[Flying Spaghetti Monster].

Also the "obligation to reach Salvation" is boring like for many other prophetic <<flg-religion,religion>>.

From a purely strategic point of view, the metaphysics is a trade-off:

* some people will believe you are a freaking living God
* others will laugh at you and say you are a charlatan

It may be argued however that Li played this card beautifully: since all Chinese power is concentrated in the CCP, any non-CCP movement dies out, so he was better off long run playing the metaphysics game. The only other choice would have been joining the CCP.

To Ciro it is obvious that Falun Gong is just one of the many very similar movements that came out of the Qi Gong Boom, such as: <<zhong-gong>>. It just happens to be the one that survived due to better luck and strategy.

The absolute truth is already known by the <<li-hongzhi,prophet>>, although he does not want to give clear evidence for reasons: <<flg-verifiable>>, and Ciro finds that utterly boring. There's no fun in living in a world where the absolute truth has been found.

For these reasons, Ciro cannot bother to read even into the self-help part: how can you read that when there is so much bullshit every other page?

Ciro would really like to know if <<li-hongzhi>> really believes in FLG himself, or is just a complete manipulating charlatan, but unfortunately we will never know that. Just imagine if before he died he published a video saying: "it was a joke, gotcha!". Now that would be **epic**!

Since Ciro is good-natured, it's hard for him to believe that he doesn't believe in anything, how can anyone be that evil? Maybe he believes in part of it, but made up some stuff to sell it better, maybe with good intentions that selling the fake part would also lead more people to see the good part?

Like any other prophetic religion, FLG gives tiny evidence that you can directly feel through meditation. The energies, which Ciro believe are real feelings. And then using that entry point asks you to believe a whole lot more, that you can't feel: <<flg-verifiable>>.

This becomes especially strong when a critical mass of believers is reached, and then they start interpreting all sorts of events as miracles, and you start to believe other believers without questioning them, and a circle is formed.

This post by a former believer gives what Ciro feels is a realistic account that matches Ciro's observations: <<me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-2017>>.

And yet, all those who love freedom, must oppose FLG ban, or be themselves enslaved by tyrants themselves: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.

In any case, at least FLG got one thing right: the commies are <<ccp-evil,evil>>, and we have to get rid of them.

[[how-much-does-ciro-santilli-know-about-falun-gong]]
==== How much does Ciro Santilli know about Falun Gong? (三西猴对法轮功有多熟悉？)

He hasn't read their <<flg-canon,canon>> himself, no patience, but he has had <<flg-bias,constant contact with believers>> and so has an idea of its content.

Ciro has summarized his thoughts about <<falun-gong>> at: <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong>> and <<flg-religion>>

[[flg-religion]]
=== Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？

If asked if they follow a religion, most FLG believers will say "no", and <<li-hongzhi>> explicitly says that in <<flg-canon>>, e.g. https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/jjyz52.htm[]:

____
Falun Dafa is not a religion, but future generations will regard it as one.
____

E.g. they call themselves "practitioners" or "students" (学员) or "disciples of the Great Law" (大法弟子, or mare accurately, of <<li-hongzhi>>'s Law) instead of "believers", and their peers "practitioner colleagues" (https://baike.baidu.com/item/同修[同修]). Non believers call them derogatorily "轮子"("little wheels"), or in friendly terms "轮友" (wheel friend).

And if you say you don't believe in their FLG metaphysics bullshit, they will often reply "he does not understand".

To them, it is not about belief, the truth is clear, and you just don't see it yet.

To this you should reply: "and you don't understand that <<li-hongzhi,Li Hongzhi>> is a master manipulator dude who deceived you and millions of others".

But <<ciro-santilli>> strongly believes that this is just a language barrier/FLG propaganda question (see also <<different-levels-of-truth>>), and that 99.9999% of people in the West would classify FLG as a religion just like <<christianity>> if they are told about FLG's beliefs:

* absolute truth comes from an enlightened <<li-hongzhi,prophet>>, who is perfect and has superhuman abilities
* weekly in-person meetings (学法 "study the Fa", or more verbosely "study the law (of the universe (of <<li-hongzhi>>))"）or daily online meetings where they read from a <<flg-canon,sacred book>>, either written by the prophet, or transcribed from his presentations to disciples, including the disciples questions, much like traditional Chinese texts like <<analects>>, just like Christians read from the Bible over and over again.
+
In both cases, some believers claim that sometimes even reading the same text again gives them new insight.
* prescribed daily meditation exercise hours, somewhat like Muslim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah[Salah] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/礼拜_(伊斯兰教)[礼拜]) prayers which they call https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazhengnian[发正念 (fa1 zheng4 nian4)], which means "send righteous thoughts". They seem to believe that this meditation helps external good magic things happen, so it is half meditation half prayer.
+
And for those that are often online on the Falun Gong voice forums, some nice music is played before prayer times, just like Muslim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muezzin[Muezzins] (a type of priest) will do the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan[Adhan] (sang call to prayer, ideally from the minarets of a mosque)
* longer "less mandatory" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong[Qigong-like] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/气功[气功]) exercises (lian4 gong1, 练功) followed by a meditation (打坐) and which they collectively call https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/修道_(道教)[修炼] "practice austerities". note that this term is borrowed from Taoism but possibly with different precise meaning. There are exactly 5 exercises (meditation being the fifth) some with a fun supernatural name, on <<flg-canon>> https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006_4.htm[] "The Falun Gong Practice System":
** Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms
** Falun Standing Stance
** Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes
** Falun Cosmic Orbit
* memorization of the <<flg-canon>>, notably <<zhuan-falun>>, just like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafiz_(Quran)[Hafiz] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哈菲茲_(稱謂)[哈菲兹]) in Islam
* higher intelligent beings ("Buddhas")
* <<promised-powers-or-knowledge,some believers who practice really well can also get some "supernatural powers">>
** other dimensions, which some select people with vision superpowers can see, this being one of the supernatural powers that may be developed, the "Celestial Eye" https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_21.htm[]:
+
[[flg-cross-dimensional-vision]]
____
A cultivator of a particular attainment level can only see the scenes on that level. He cannot see or believe the truth beyond that level. Therefore, he only believes what he has seen on his own level. When he has not gone up to such a high level of cultivation, he would think those things do not exist and are incredible.
____
+
and the "Supernormal Capability of Remote Sight" is a closely related ability: https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_22.htm:
+
____
A supernormal capability directly connected with the Celestial Eye is called the Remote Sight. Someone says that he can see scenes in Beijing, in America or scenes on the other side of the earth while sitting here.
____
+
And finally there is also the past-future vision ability "Supernormal Capability of Total Recall" https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_23.htm[]:
+
____
 There is another supernormal capability which has a direct relation with the Celestial Eye. It is called Total Recall. Now there are six supernormal capabilities which are generally recognized in the world. They include the Celestial Eye, Remote Sight, and Total Recall. What is Total Recall? It is a supernormal capability with which one can know a person's future and past; if the ability is great, one can know the rise and decline of a society; if the ability is even greater, one can see the Law of the change of the whole celestial body.
____
* aliens that look like humans are amongst us, they gave us part of our modern technology, some are evil, others not so evil. E.g. https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980530L.html[]:
+
____
Science, however, is not something gods imparted to humans. Instead, it was passed down to humans by alien beings inside the Three Realms, and for the purpose of controlling humankind. People's belief in it has surpassed everything. But I tell you that precisely because of its shallowness, this science has caused the degeneration of morality in human society.
____
+
Despite this however, Falun Gong benefits from information technology enormously. For example, many (most?) believers use the Internet daily to study the Fa, and to organize their <<falun-gong-media,media outlets>>.
* meetings in which people tell their religious testimonies ("experience sharing" TODO Chinese name, possibly just "分享修炼的美好", e.g. https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2015/9/29/分享修炼的美好-印尼召开修炼心得交流会（图）-316838.html[source]): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony#Religion
+
As Jesus put it in https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A20&version=NIV[Matthew 18:20]:
+
____
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them
____
+
which highlights the critical believer mass effect of reinforced beliefs.
* an impending link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment[final judgment]-like event, which will happen "very soon" (<<flg-verifiable,unspecified date>>), and in which the just will be rewarded
+
Ciro predict that when <<li-hongzhi>> dies, the claim will be that he went to another dimension so save us all, therefore putting this final judgment on hold, a bit like Jesus.
* non-believers are fundamentally different from believers. Although non-followers who do good things are actually doing FLG without knowing it.
+
FLG has a specific terminology for non-believers, which is translated in English as https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_new_4.html["ordinary people"] (常人), as opposed to Falun Gong Believers, which Li calls Falun Gong disciples (大法弟子).
+
Non-FLG people should therefore logically call Falun Gong believers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_psychology[abnormal people] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/異常心理學[异常人]) in return, much like Ciro likes to call the Chinese who call him 老外 as "老内".
+
Like other aspects of FLG however, this appears in other religions, e.g. my mother mentioned the funny term used by her Protestant's group term but Ciro forgot it, and you can see it in Harry Potter as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle[The Muggles].
* xref:flg-organized[You can support FLG by doing X and Y, it is not mandatory, but why wouldn't you since you are saving other people?]. Explaining that Falun Gong is good contrary to CCP propaganda also known as "Fa-rectification" in the English translation jargon.
* alternate dimensions
* pre-civilization: civilization is actually much older than what we believe, and was super advanced, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse[societal collapse] events led us to forget about it, a bit like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis[atlantis].
+
Notably, this also implies that the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution[theory of evolution] is wrong, since there existed modern humans hundred of millions of years ago (the current scientific estimates for anatomically modern humans is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human[500,000 years]): https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_14.htm
+
____
Archaeologists have found in the world a kind of organism called "three-leaves insect", which came into being between 600 million and 260 million years ago, and became extinct thereafter. An American scientist found a fossil of "three-leaves insect", on which there was also a human footprint, left by a shoe he was wearing, and clearly printed on the fossil. Aren't they joking with the historians? How could there possibly have been human beings 260 million years ago according to Darwin's theory of evolution?
____
* xref:flg-medication[Maybe FLG will make you healthier, but no promises, but it will make you a better person, and that's why you should do it, but if you really really believe, you get healthier]. But people who seemed to be believers also die, because deep within their hearts, there was a belief problem.
* <<falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils>>

From this, it is obvious that Falun Gong is just a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age[New Age] (link:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/新纪元运动[新纪元运动]) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism[syncretic] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/綜攝[综摄]) religion combining https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong[Qigong], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism[Buddhism], some aspects of <<christianity>>, and whatever other crazy things <<li-hongzhi>> believes in.

Synchronism is of course the easiest way to start a new religion, because it attempts to divert the irrational belief of people in some unprovable bullshit into a new unprovable bullshit, but that resonates more with the current political situation. This is exactly what Jesus did with Judaism. And it is then exactly what the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam[Islam did to Christianity].

Or you could call Falun Gong a <<flg-cult,cult>>, which is nothing but a new/small religion with negative connotation, and thus meaningless.

FLG is very similar to Scientology in Ciro's view: a new religion that mixes elements of both old and new. And just like any other religion, <<democracy-is-a-religion,their practice must be allowed>>.

But consider this: how to classify what a religion is?

Some would answer: science is what every one can perceive with their own senses.

But FLG followers claim to feel FLG energies when doing the exercises, and a few of them have the power of seeing the other dimensions.

On the other hand, how many of your friends have experienced the laws of quantum field theory or general relativity in a very direct way?

And aren't pro-democracy believers also taking actions based solely on a shared belief, possibly organized by a pro-democracy leader?

From a purely strategic point of view, the "religion" denomination would be:

* bad to FLG because the concept of freedom of religion carries considerable weight in the West. And if you are not a religion, you are more likely to be a <<flg-cult,cult>>, which carries a black mark instead.
* good for FLG because people who already have a religion would be less likely to try it out and start believing
+
Falun Gong's recruitment strategy is to focus on the exercises first, and in particular its <<flg-medication,health benefits>> and then as some people start to feel things, they start introducing the metaphysics.
+
Other new religions have also taken this "I'm not a religion approach", see e.g.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baháʼí_Faith[Baha'i] https://youtu.be/9qDN0COSvds?t=287[].

[[falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils]]
==== Falun Gong believes that the CCP is literally a manifestation of real devils (法轮功认为中共是真正恶魔的化身)

Unlike <<ciro-santilli>> which does <<is-chinese-politician-x-evil,not think most CCP politicians are actually evil>>, Falun Gong seems to believe that they literally as in they are representatives of, or evil supernatural beings themselves.

E.g. <<jiang-zemin>> is actually an evil frog in some alternate dimension, literally, not just memecally.

And those devils they are literally responsible for example for creating <<covid,Covid-19>>, which is itself a magic force which tests the evil and good: <<falun-gongs-view-of-epidemics>>.

And <<flg-trump,Trump>> likely represents a magical anti-devil force of the universe.

Some of the most direct <<flg-canon,canon>> suggestions we could find: https://en.falundafa.org/eng/HongYin5.htm[]:

____
The Red Devil uses lies and money to meddle with man
____

https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20060209A.html[]:

____
All along, lowlife secret agents of the wicked CCP have been constantly gathering so-called "Falun Gong intelligence."
____

Falun Gong gives the CCP too much credit. The CCP are just a bunch of lazy and greedy people like you and me.

[[falun-gong-preaching]]
==== Falun Gong preaching (法轮功传教)

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-air_preaching[Street preaching] is an important aspect of Falun Gong, using stands and leaflets on the streets much like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses[Jehovah's Witnesses].

Jargon:

* http://www.minghui.org/mh/glossary.html[讲真相]: "truth-telling"
* hongfa (TODO characters?)

The Falun Gong organization also specifies guidelines on how to preach, although these might not be <<flg-canon,canon>>, even though if they are not, it is extremely likely that <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> is directly involved in their specification

Falun Gong has also used <<flg-telemarketing,phone call preaching>>.

All of this is part of their effort to "save people (救人)", i.e. convert them to Falun Gong.

<<li-hongzhi>> personally heavily emphasises the importance of preaching in <<flg-canon>> TODO link/quote, and because of this is it a de-facto religious obligation, and a major part of <<making-cult-members-work-long-hours-for-free>>.

.Falun Gong believers preaching on the street in London in 2016. This image taken from a believer website shows a typical local regular gathering of believers on weekends, or even week days if there are enough retired believers in the group. They will put on their exercise music, and do exercises to attract more followers. Someone will also stand on their stall giving out propaganda flyers, or asking people to sign petitions for Western governments to support Falun Gong, e.g. opposing their alleged <<flg-organ-harvesting,organ harvesting>>. In the case of touristic areas with Chinese people walking around, they will also ask the Chinese tourists to <<tuidang,quit the their CCP membership, possibly using a fake name>>. <<ciro-santilli>> has to say: it is very amusing to see those Chinese people trying to pretend to ignore the censored religion, when some of them are clearly curious about it, especially the younger ones who didn't see it live. Some just get mad, and say how the CCP is so great to them. https://truthinchina.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/london-uk-practitioners-explain-the-facts-about-falun-gong-in-st-martins-place-photos/[Source].

===== Some Falun Gong people make phone telemarketing (一些法轮功人搞电话推销)

Ciro Santilli has seen Falun Gong people making phone calls to people in China with to explain why FLG is with his own eyes, and therefore is sure it has happened on some scale.

Particularly during <<covid>>, Falun Gong ramped up the telemarketing calls and some voluntary believers were making calls all day nonstop.

Ciro does not know how the called numbers were obtained and if callees voluntarily signed up for it, but that feels extremely unlikely.

Interestingly however, many of the callees seemed interesting in what they had to say, and they often had long chats, Ciro was surprised by that. Maybe they were just bored senseless due to the Corona lockdown. Or maybe <<most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship,many Chinese People actually don't like their Government>> and the CCP is fucked.

Also, of course, the callers received call scripts and guidelines to makes those calls, because obviously <<flg-organized>>.

Ciro strongly disapproves of this, Just like for any product, visual ads on the street are impossible to prevent, but any kind of advertising that generates notifications on feeds, or takes people's time, is unacceptable.

As you can easily find on <<google>>/<<baidu>>, such calls may be reported in the <<cac-report-website>>.

Ciro has not however seen them talking about making automated phone calls.

https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1940394/how-rampant-phone-scams-highlight-chinas-need-tighter also mentions that Falun Gong makes telemarketing in passing without any reference.

[[flg-cult]]
==== Is Falun Gong a cult? (法轮功是邪教吗？)

Does <<ciro-santilli>> think Falun Gong a cult? Yes.

Is the CCP a cult? Yes: <<ccp-cult>>.

Is <<christianity>> a cult? Yes.

Is democracy a cult? Yes: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.

Is modern science a cult? Maybe.

Therefore, the only question that matters for all the above is the same: are they good or bad cults?

Falun Gong clearly share many many many characteristics with what many people classify as a "cult", see e.g.: <<orange-papers>>.

However, <<ciro-santilli>> strongly believes that so does any other existing religion e.g. Christianity, and that Falun Gong is not any worse or better than those other well known religions.

Ciro therefore believes that the only reasonable stances are to either:

* be against all religions (including Christianity and Falun Gong), and classify all of them as Cults
* allow both Christianity and Falun Gong to exist, and support religious freedom

but not "oppose Falun Gong" and support Christianity.

Some people will say: Falun Gong is a cult because it is too new and therefore obviously fake!

So, if I tell a lie today, will it become true in a thousand years? Or a truth today become a lie? The Romans called <<christianity>> the "Cult of Jesus"!

Try sending an email to <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> asking him to <<flg-verifiable,prove his powers to you>> :-)

Others will say: Falun Gong is a cult because its prophet is still alive!

But then, worry not, because Li Hongzhi was born in 1951, and therefore will almost certainly die by 2040, unless he truly is a living God as he claims.

Now, for the really important question of weather Falun Gong is a "good" or "bad" religion, <<ciro-santilli>> has seen absolutely nothing in it that is worse than any <<flg-religion,other major religion>> say, e.g., <<christianity>>.

Some possibly neutral Cult analysts analyzing if FLG is good or bad:

* https://www.icsahome.com/articles/the-prc-and-falun-gong-langone

Against:

* https://www.culteducation.com/group/1254-falun-gong.html

In the end however, since there is nothing obviously completely creepy about FLG, all such discussions are basically equivalent to <<democracy-is-a-religion,"is the Left better than the Right">>, and cannot be answered.

One interesting linguistic aspect is that "cult" normally translates in Chinese as "邪教" which means "Evil religion".

As mentioned before, Ciro does not believe that FLG is an "Evil Cult", just another "Acceptable Cult", and therefore would not use "邪教" to describe it.

Amusingly, <<li-hongzhi,Li>> calls the communists Communist Evil Party (中共邪党) in cannon, well played: https://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jiangfa5_2.htm

The word "Cult" is much more ambiguous in English however, and does not necessarily imply "Evil" in certain contexts, just "worship".

For example, People from <<ciro-santilli>>'s mother's Protestant Church in Brazil, all say that they are going "to the cult" ("culto" in Portuguese) when referring to when they are going to church to pray, sing and read the Bible together, here's a Wikipedia page in Portuguese page about it: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culto_(Evangelicalismo)

And obviously, the origin of the word "cult" is exactly the same as that of https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cultivate#Etymology["cultivate"] as in "cultivate the crops" (which is also how Falun Gong believers refer to practicing Falun Gong: "cultivation practice"). All of those come from the https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cult#Etymology[Latin "colō"], which means simply "to protect".

[[ccp-cult]]
===== CCP cult (中共邪教)

The CCP also has many cult-like characteristics, notably <<xi-jinping,"The Guru is always right">>, which is mentioned on <<orange-papers>> itself under "The Guru is always right." (highlight by <<ciro-santilli,Ciro>>):

____
The Guru, his church, and his teachings are always right, and above criticism, and beyond reproach.

In some cults, the guru is dead, but the principle is the same. I use the word "guru" loosely here; in many cults the charismatic leader has the title of minister, priest, yogi, swami, prophet, or all-knowing wise man. **Or even, "<<mao-zedong,Chairman Mao>>."** In any case, the leader is always right.
____

And they also claim that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous[Alcoholics Anonymous] could be characterized as a cult. Very cool. What else could be powerful enough to get you off a physical addiction, than a mental addiction, right? The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Mass_(miniseries)[Midnight Mass (2021)] miniseries by Netflix episode 2 makes that suggestion nicely on a side by side collage at about 8 minutes. It later mentions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Recovery[Rational Recovery (RR)], which is a "non-religious" alternative to the AA.

____
<<mao-zedong,Mao>> is the Father +
<<xi-jinping,Xi>> is the Son +
The CCP is the Holy Spirit
____

Both Mao and Xi have produced their own sacred books which must be revered, much like <<li-hongzhi>>'s <<flg-canon>>:

* Xi's: <<xi-jinping-thought>>
** illustrated version for children: <<xi-jinping-thought-primary-school-textbook-2021>>
* Mao's: <<little-red-book>>

Furthermore, both of those books are based on speeches, just like just like Li Hongzhi's speeches become instant canon.

This devotion can also be seen in Xi's benevolent personification: <<xi-dada>>.

This is also observed by <<falun-gong>> itself as a response to the CCP <<flg-cult,accusing Falun Gong of being an Evil Cult>>. E.g.: https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/2019/07/01/a102612683.html from <<ntdtv>>, and Falun Gong is completely right here.

_____
共产党已同一个邪教差不多，是不可以信赖的、不可以和它靠近的。否则，多好的人，也会变坏。 +
The Communist Party is almost the same as a cult. It cannot be trusted or approached. Otherwise, even good people will become bad.

Amazing website talking about Cults and many other things!

The key page of the website is the "Cult Test": https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html[]. This is a must read. It is basically the https://cirosantilli.com/tv-tropes[TV Tropes] of Cults.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Orangepapers/comments/5sh7kg/any_info_on_what_happened_to_the_orange_papers/ mentions the creator's first name is "Terry", and that the website went down due to financial trouble.

* `Orange_Papers-imgs000-2011-01-01.tar.gz`

A mirror with many broken links and images: http://aorange1.tripod.com/

And the website also has a Free Tibet flag at the bottom.

Many of the points highlighted at are very very interesting and Ciro feels that they apply strongly to <<falun-gong>>:

* "Instant Community" and "Instant intimacy": you instantly join the cult family, and are very very likely to believe or at least consider anything anyone else in the cult says about their religious experiences, no matter how far-fetched, even though it is not <<flg-canon,canon>>
+
Conversely, this also poses a risk for the Cult Leader, as new community ideas can spread very quickly, and if you try to fight them off, they might create a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism[Schism].
* "Denigration of competing sects, cults, religions, groups, or organizations": yes, <<li-hongzhi>> does this all the time, see: <<zhong-gong>>
* "Personal testimonies of earlier converts": see "experience sharing" at <<flg-religion>>
* "The group and its members are special", "Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider": see: "ordinary people (常人)" at <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong>>
* "Front groups, masquerading recruiters, hidden promoters, and disguised propagandists": <<falun-gong-media>>
* "The Guru is always right", "You are always wrong", "No Graduates", "The Guru Is Extra-Special", "Everybody else needs the guru to boss him around, but nobody bosses the guru around", "The guru criticizes everybody else, but nobody criticizes the guru.": obviously: <<li-hongzhi>>
** "Group-think, Suppression of Dissent, and Enforced Conformity in Thinking"
* Giggly wonderfulness and starry-eyed faith: <<flg-religion,notably visible during in experience sharing>>

There are also however some points which Ciro feels don't apply, and Ciro praises Falun Gong for those:

* "Dual Purposes": not much of that, most of their propaganda is "we are persecuted unfairly by China", not "let's help the poor"
* "The End Justifies The Means": Li has made it clear that believers must follow the laws of their countries. Cults that violate this tend to not last as long, this is the smart move for cult leaders.

And some points which Ciro feels apply which were mentioned in some other article, (or maybe in Orange Papers but he couldn't find them, TODO find reference?)

* "No time for fun": how could you possibly spend leisure time watching television, etc. when you could be saving the world instead?
* "Focus on the persecution of the Cult": while obviously people who have been persecuted have the right, and almost an obligation, to look for help and share their stories, it is also clear that this is a selling point for the Cult.
+
Why would a nation state attack a Cult? This could give the impression that it is because there is something powerful and true in the Cult, and actually menaces this nation state.
+
For example, Falun Gong puts huge emphasis on its persecution in China, much like the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr[Martyrdom] of the Catholic Saints is highly emphasised.

This is especially interesting, because the website does not mention Falun Gong at all it seems: it really seems that all those cults are very similar.

It should also be mentioned though that these points extend to any type of human organization, e.g. <<flg-religion,other religions>>, <<democracy-is-a-religion,political parties>>, job associations, etc.

[[cult-speak]]

https://web.archive.org/web/20160205090248/https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak

"Cult-speak": see also "Newspeak" from <<nineteen-eighty-four>> and some common Falun Gong Cult-speak see: <<flg-religion>>

Falun Gong's slogan is the quite direct to the point:

____
法轮大法好
Falun Gong is good
____

This is in part to fight off the mountains of anti-Falun Gong propaganda created by the <<ccp>>.

Their core values are:

* Truthfulness (真, Zhēn). Self explanatory, and the opposite of the <<ccp>>. Although they sometimes violate that (unknowingly?) for the greater good of the cult, e.g. <<flg-transparent>>.
* Compassion (善, Shàn)
* Forbearance (忍, Rěn): definition according to Oxford Languages: "patient self-control, restraint and tolerance". So in other words: chill out and meditate. And don't do drugs or anything excessive like that.

The slogan and the core values are often placed together as:

____
法轮大法好。真善忍好。
Falun Gong is good. Truthfulness, compassion and forbearance are good.
____

[[careful-control-of-your-image]]
====== Careful control of your image (Orange Papers, 小心控制你的形象, 橙色文件)

The cult leader is a master at controlling how people view them.

One aspect of that, is after reaching a certain critical mass of mindless followers, to limit your public appearances to situations in which you have the most control, and notably being surrounded only by your believers.

Because of course: you are human, not a God, and you are going to fuck up from time to time, so why take any risks now that you are already established?

<<li-hongzhi>> does not announce where he is going for the most part, even though he is followed by millions: he just shows up unannounced, and local believers whisper to one another in short advance and come to see him when possible.

As a result, there are almost no recordings of Li Hongzhi except from the early days when he actually had to go out and get new believers hooked himself.

What if he farted, or worse, brain-farted during a presentation, like we all do from time to time? Don't want recordings of that, do we? <<flg-canon>> related to those private presentations is only published after careful review of course.

Ciro also heard similar stories of <<stalin>> and <<mao-zedong>> when they would retreat from the public eye for a while. Part of appearance control generally requires you to select select <<membership-rivalry-orange-papers,cult members of the inner circle>> to act for you, so you can minimize your surface of errors.

And closely related: "Deceptive Recruiting"

Falun Gong people don't talk freely about their funny beliefs like <<flg-religion,aliens are amongst us>> to outsiders.

Rather, they lure you in with the exercises first.

Ciro has personally heard the following said many times: "you should not tell this to non-believers, they are not ready for this truth yet".

Conversely, <<dictatorship,dictatorships>>, just like <<flg-cult,cults>>, also have practice different levels of truth, because in the end some level of decision maker has to know the actual truth of the world:

* <<brave-new-world-books>>
* <<internal-media-of-china>>
* <<chernobyl-2019-miniseries>>

[[making-cult-members-work-long-hours-for-free]]
====== Making cult members work long hours for free (Orange papers, 让信徒免费长时间工作, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200219/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q9.html#cq_work4free

Many Falun Gong members work long long hours for free to help spread their religion, either by:

* <<falun-gong-preaching,preaching on the streets by giving out leaflets or demonstrating their exercise>>
* working for <<falun-gong-media>>

because spreading those are religious obligations.

But on the other hand, why wouldn't do that if you believed that there is a <<li-hongzhi,living god on our Earth which most "ordinary people" don't know about>>, and that you are saving people's souls? If a religion doesn't make you do things for it, that belief is useless. In the case of Christianity however this is possibly in part linked to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism[Evangelical] belief of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_gratia[salvation by grace alone]. Quite convenient right, you don't really have to do anything concrete to be saved, only believe and repent.

Furthermore, a very similar mindset is present in entrepreneurs, who are often driven to do long long work for an ideal. Sometimes, e.g. in <<ciro-santilli>>'s case, even to make https://cirosantilli.com/ourbigbook-com[a not-for-profit].

And Ciro Santilli's mother would spend countless hours helping the less fortunate after her retirement in activities semi-linked to her Protestant church.

So this point is not so simple to criticize.

But it is sad to watch people waste their lives <<flg-fake,for something that is a lie>>.

https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132516/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q7.html#cq_member_rivalry

While <<ciro-santilli>> hasn't personally witnessed any malicious internal competition in Falun Gong, this does make the more interesting point that:

____
Members vie with one another for the <<li-hongzhi,guru>>'s attention, and for status within the group. Everyone is trying to become part of the favored inner circle. The leader plays the members off against each other in order to maintain his hold over the cult.
____

and this is very true. Because since you, <<flg-fake,everything is a lie>> you <<promised-powers-or-knowledge,don't get the promised goods>>, and the only thing that is left for you to actually get is the guru's attention and the social status associated with it.

The inner circle status mechanic is also closed related to <<careful-control-of-your-image>>, see the <<vissarion,Vissarion>> video.

Some inner circle mechanics are also well shown in <<wild-wild-country-2017>> through Sheela.

[[flg-canon]]
=== Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong

It appears that Falun Gong cannon is present at: https://falundafa.org/

The two main books are:

* "China Falun Gong" (中国法轮功) AKA just "Falun Gong" published in April 1993. 2006 English translation https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006.htm[]. Wikipedia comments:
+
____
Falun Gong is an introductory book that discusses qigong, introduces the principles of the practice, and provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises.
____
+
The first edition contains one of http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130###
* <<zhuan-falun>>

The initial versions of both of those texts contained versions of <<li-hongzhis-hagiography>>.

It contains <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>>'s approved texts/speech transcriptions, which are sacred.

The only sacred version is Chinese which is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_language[sacred language], and of which there is only one perfect revision.

This is <<flg-religion,perfectly analogous>> to the role of:

* Arabic in Islam. Although Islam goes even further, and only the Arabic version can be recited in prayers. Non-Arabic-speakers have to just memorize sounds to perform Salah. https://nationalinterest.org/feature/plight-uyghurs-why-muslims-wont-speak-their-brethren-112466 suggests that this is a major reason why <<other-islam-countries-speak-up-for-uyghur>>
* Hebrew in Judaism

Protestants and later the Catholic church, have moved away from such really bad strategy however, the accessibility of Christianity is seen on the entrance of many many churches which have a sign "ALL are welcome". Perhaps this is also related to the fact that Christianism was already based on translating earlier Judaic texts to Greek, so the sacred language barrier was already broken. Well played.

<<ciro-santilli>> heard <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> claims the specifically chose to reincarnate in China this last time.

The English translation is made by followers, and gets new revisions from time to time to reduce translation imperfections.

However, the Chinese language seems to be fundamentally sacred, and there might never be a sacred English version approved by LHZ.

LHZ is of course a de-facto God with superpowers, and can of course speak all languages, but https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=for%20reasons[for reasons] he didn't just write an English translation himself.

This is a reasonable command to download the English cannon for grepping:

....
wget -r -l inf --no-remove-listing --no-clobber --no-parent -w 2 https://en.falundafa.org/falun-dafa-books.html
....

TODO: need to find a way to wrap lines, otherwise grep might fail on sentences.

But funnily the Canon books appear to all be copyrighted, likely "to avoid other people from modifying his sacred text", which is funny since the dude's the voice of absolute truth of the universe, but you still gotta copyright that I guess.

Nothing else is canonical. LHZ seems to have said that there are enlightened followers, but has not specified who, so we can't derive canon from anyone else.

Notably, <<flg-organized,FLG media>> such as https://www.minghui.org/ is believer led and thus not canonical, even though believers have very high confidence in it, and LHZ <<flg-organized,directly supports it>>.

CCP <<ccp-cult,cult leaders>> such as <<xi-jinping>> and <<mao-zedong>> have also published their own canon books, e.g.:

* Xi's: <<xi-jinping-thought>>
* Mao's: <<little-red-book>>

[[zhuan-falun]]
==== Zhuan Falun (转法轮)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong#Zhuan_Falun,_the_main_book
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/转法轮_(书)

The main book of <<flg-canon>>.

Published in January 1995.

1998 English version: https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_01.htm[]:

According to Wikipedia:

____
Zhuan Falun is the main teaching and the most comprehensive work; it is an edited version of Li's nine-lecture series, 54 of which he taught across China between 1992 and 1994.
____

Believers very often read from this text when they <<flg-religion,"study the Fa">> in their gatherings. They often read one chapter per session, and can often just say "we read the Nth teaching" (第N讲, so apparently each chapter corresponds to a separate talk). Just like <<xi-jinping-thought>> (and other Chinese religious traditions)!

.Front and back cover of <<zhuan-falun>>, first edition (1994). It is said amongst believers that <<flg-verifiable,the Lotus flower on the back of these books have magically opened progressively as time passed>>. http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=165###[Source].
image::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Zhuan_Falun.jpg[height=500]

[[does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-or-just-use-it-because-it-is-censored]]
=== Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong, or just use it because it is censored? (三西猴是支持法轮功，还是仅仅因为它被审查而使用它？)

Ciro Santilli doesn't support FLG specifically, only freedom of religion. See of course: <<flg-bias>>.

Ciro uses it in his usernames simply because it is the most banned and censored one in China today.

He believe that <<flg-thoughtcrime,individuals should only be put in jail for what they do, not for what they believe>>.

He considers FLG <<flg-religion,a religion like any other>>, and he is against its ban, as that of all other religions.

He also believes that freedom of speech and democracy imply that FLG and other religions will exist. If you want freedom, you have to <<intolerance,accept other people's choices>>.

Otherwise, <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy and communism can also be considered as religions>>, and banned.

See also: <<flg-verifiable>>.

[[flg-daily]]
=== How is it like to live with Falun Gong believers? (与法轮功信徒一起生活是一种怎样的体验？)

This will obviously vary from believer to believer, but here is <<ciro-santilli>>'s experience.

Like any other religion that is taken seriously, they spend several hours per week doing their standard religious activities: <<flg-religion>>.

Ciro has never seen them, or anyone we know from FLG say or do something that he consider morally incorrect because of FLG.

This does not prevent <<wife,his wife>> from working normally.

Ciro's mother-in-law, who is retired, dedicates all her time to Falun Gong when she is not taking care of the house.

Ciro's mother is also religious (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism[Protestant]), and he gets a very similar feeling about both groups.

Like other religions, Falun Gong gives them meaning in life, and Ciro admires that they pursue their belief energetically, just as he persues his beliefs energetically.

Ciro much prefers that Ciro's mother-in-law does Falun Gong, which is a noble meaningful goal, rather than watch stupid crap on television.

Also, although he is <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,agnostic>>, Ciro also lives in a similar way.

Ciro's religion is that of science and technology, and he pursue it fervently by trying to learn and teach it and spend several hours a week doing that, even when it does not give him money immediately.

If Ciro pursue his meaning, why should he prevent anyone from pursuing theirs?

Previously, Ciro's wife and mother-in-law would sometimes try to persuade him to learn Falun Gong, which was annoying.

But every time he told them very clearly that he knows where to download the books if I want to, and that he may never want to read them, and that his wife must either accept this fact or leave him.

And they have accepted that: they think Ciro's a good person, and they can accept that you can also be a good person even without doing Falun Gong.

Ciro does feel Falun Gong makes Ciro's mother-in-law more reluctant to use or actively search for <<flg-medication,medication or treatment>>. But he thinks it is also linked to the fact that she didn't have a very good education or a good health system around. However, if Ciro and his wife give her something, she will take it. Ciro's wife does not have any resistance to medication.

One thing that does worry Ciro is that Ciro's mother in law sleeps too little every night, doing one of the Falun Gong meditations late in the evening, and then waking up very early to a long series of reading and exercise sessions. But it is hard to say if she would be any different without Falun Gong, it could just be her nature.

[[flg-changed]]
=== Falun Gong is completely different in the West than it was in China (法轮功在西方与在中国完全不同)

I believe that it has changed.

But isn't that the case of every cultural religious movement that migrates to a completely new culture?

Main points which may have changed:

* It has become more organized.
+
But why shouldn't they organize to defend themselves now that they have the chance without being put into prison?
+
The CCP is highly organized and has way more resources.
* Less emphasis is given to the religious/mystical aspect, and more to the corporal exercises, and health aspect.
+
This may be because people in the "West" are:
+
** are "scientific-educated" atheists who wouldn't go for a "religion"
** already have other religions, which would view FLG as a taboo

Also maybe only the richest and most educated believers managed to escape China, and thus the movement carried that bias outside China.

If you know more ways in which it may have changed, let me know.

But once again, we can know nothing for sure about the past in China because of censorship.

Even if you saw something yourself, how can you be sure that it is representative?

And if it has changed, now that it has changed, maybe China should unban it?

[[falun-gong-has-been-funded-by-the-us-government-at-least-once-therefore-it-is-evil]]
=== Falun Gong has been funded by the US government at least once, therefore it is evil (法轮功至少被美国政府资助过一次，所以是邪恶的)

1.5M USD in 2010 for a FLG controlled internet freedom group https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm

But well, if you are going to do something anyway, and someone offers you money, why wouldn't you take it?

Taking the money does of course give a "bad impression" that someone is trying to buy influence, but does it in itself imply that you are doing something bad?

But do you really think that the US government paid that to buy influence in FLG? What would they force upon that FLG group that they didn't already want to do? Isn't it more likely that the US government wanted them to continue doing exactly what they were doing?

Every government funds groups it supports, it is an all out war I suppose. Compare that to the propaganda funds of the CCP.

What about the funding of political campaigns, which vastly outnumbers 1.5M USD every year?

[[follow-the-law]]
=== Falun Gong is illegal in China, we must follow the law (法轮功在中国是非法的，我们必须遵守法律)

If a law is unfair, we must fight to change it.

It was perfectly legal for <<nazi,Nazis>> to kill Jews. Does it make that right?

But in the end, the commies don't even bother passing or following laws, they just fuck people anyways without one: <<rule-of-law>>.

The problem in <<dictatorship,dictatorships>> is that the people have no power at all to change the law because there is no <<democracy>>.

The excuse that "we have to do this to follow Chinese law in order to operate in China", is exactly what all <<western-companies-that-comply-with-chinese-censorship-requests>> do. If Chinese law mandated killing Jews, they would likely comply.

The trick though is to delegate the dirty work to Chinese branches and employees, as a way to distance themselves from the activity. This is also generally a regulatory requirement of the Chinese government however.

[[flg-fake]]
=== Falun Gong is fake (法轮功是假的)

The same can be argued about any other religion or political belief of type: it is better if we organize society in this or that way.

How can you disprove their belief, when as in any other religion, every affirmation made hinges on "miracles only happen around when true believers are around" or "only true believers can perceive evidence in their hearts / minds directly". He died of cancer or <<covid>>? Not a true believer, deep withing his heart, something was wrong. See also: <<flg-verifiable>>.

Conversely, do you understand the full sequence of experiments that imply quantum field theory? Have you seen videos of those experiments? Have you attended live demonstrations? Do you understand the construction of the experimentation apparatus? Yet, why do you believe it?

Because millions of religious believers feel that they have have directly observed God/other dimensions/energies/aliens/some other religious crap through direct experience several times in their lieves, or even daily. Why then is quantum field theory correct, but their daily direct religious experience wrong?

More importantly: what do you propose that should be done about it? Should we kill followers? Or is jail enough?

Also do let me know when you have achieved irrefutable proof that democracy/freedom of speech are the optimal ways to organize the government: <<democracy-is-a-religion>>.

See also: <<flg-religion>>

[[flg-verifiable]]
==== Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)

Exactly, just like any other <<flg-religion>>, this is why <<ciro-santilli>> is <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,agnostic>> and thinks Falun Gong metaphysics is bullshit.

Notably, <<li-hongzhi>> explicitly forbids display of magical powers gained by believers to non-believers: <<flg-supernatural-powers>> for "reasons". What a convenient coincidence, that prevents any verifiability!

Just like in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter[Harry Potter], Falun Gong believers are part of the magical <<flg-religion,Hogwarts world which non-believers, The Muggles>>, cannot access.

The closest claims to observable Ciro has heard are:

* when pictures are taken in sacred events, notably <<shen-yun>>, sometimes you can see magic Falun energy wheels in the pictures
* in the homes of some followers, small magic good plants-like fungi-like things have grown
+
[[flg-fungi]]
.Image of the magic good small plants that grew on a <<falun-gong>> believer's home. They took a photo and it published on <<falun-gong-media,Minghui>> as a 2018 Chinese New Year good wish page to <<li-hongzhi>>. They seem to identify those fungi as mini-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udumbara_(Buddhism)[udumbaras], which is just a fancy name that Buddhism scriptures use to refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_racemosa[cluster fig flowers] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/聚果榕[优昙婆罗], amongst a billion other existing phonetic transliterations) emphasising their magic properties.

This type of "congratulate the Master for New Year, congratulate the Master for his birthday etc. by sending photos to <<minghui>> for selection is common practice in the Falun Gong community. https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2018/2/17/168396p.html[Source].
image::{china-dictatorship-media-base}/Falun_Gong_magic_fungi.jpg[height=600]
* the <<flg-canon,sacred books>> of some believers had a closed lotus flower when they were bought, and after several years, the flower opened

but Ciro suspects they are not even <<flg-canon,canon>>, just believer oral culture.

Of course, like every other religion, reality happens to be is constructed in a way that prevents non-believers to verify anything with their eyes in a reproducible way.

Or a Jesus put it in https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4&version=NIV[Luke 4]:

____
Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.

"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written:

"'He will command his angels concerning you,

and they will lift you up in their hands,

so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"

Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
____

Ah good old <<li-hongzhi,prophets>>, their tricks haven't changed a bit in 2 thousand years! This is why <<ciro-santilli>> follows instead the religion of <<democracy-is-a-religion,science and freedom of speech>>, because those religions instead say:

____
Test your God. Test your God a billion times. And if your God proves wrong just once, disbelieve it.
____

The Pontius Pilate Scene from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)[The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)] comes to mind, quotes:

____
Pontius: It's also said that you do miracles? Is this good magic or bad magic? Can we have some sort of demonstration?

Jesus: No, I'm not a trained animal, I'm not a magician.

Pontius: Well, that's disappointing. This means that you are just another Jewish politician.
____

and:

____
Pontius: It's one way to change the way that people live, but you want to change the way that they think and that they feel.

Jesus: All I'm saying is the change will happen with love. Not with killing.

Pontius: Either way it's dangerous. It's against Rome. It's against the way the world is. In killing or loving, it's all the same. It simply doesn't matter how you want to change things, we don't want them changed.

[[against-censorship-and-flg]]
=== Many people both are against both censorship and Falun Gong (我要民主，但是我还要禁止法轮功)

Ciro know that, and that supporting FLG is "bad" for his public image with most Chinese, including those that are against censorship.

But <<dictator-needs-gfw,without censorship, there will be democracy>>, and with democracy FLG followers will have voting rights, and FLG will become legal.

Ciro thinks that the situation is very similar to <<flg-religion,Scientology>> in the USA today: most people dislike it, but believe that you can believe whatever you want.

Democracy and Communism <<democracy-is-a-religion,can also be considered as religions and persecuted>>.

Isn't it convenient when a dictatorship gets rid of those weirdos for you? But not so much when suddenly you or your family is the weirdo...

If you are not ready to accept the beliefs of others, dictatorship is the only choice for you.

It is also interesting to note how Falun Gong is a good source of <<censorship-circumvention>> material.

[[democracy-is-a-religion]]
==== Why does Ciro Santilli say that democracy is a religion just like Falun Gong? (为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)

Because it also specifies irrational and fundamental aspects of how one should live, notably voting and freedom of speech.

Just like the <<ccp-cult>> has one fundamental belief: <<stability,the Party is always right>>.

Ban <<falun-gong>>, and you have banned democracy.

Accept democracy, and you will have <<falun-gong>>.

There is no in-between.

[[flg-stability]]
==== Falun Gong had to be banned because it was a threat to the stability of the country (法轮功必须被取缔，因为它威胁到国家的稳定)

Then they link to the Taping Rebellion:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom

Of course FLG was a threat to the stability of the country.

It is, as <<ciro-santilli>> has said, a highly organized political power: <<flg-political>>.

However, <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy>> is a threat to the stability country in the exact same way:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution

Anything that goes against a dictatorship is a threat to the stability of the country.

Now read: <<stability>>

[[many-people-say-they-do-falun-gong-only-to-get-visas-to-the-usa]]
=== Many people say they do Falun Gong only to get VISAs to the USA (很多人说他们修炼法轮功只是为了拿到美国签证)

<<ciro-santilli>> heard this a few times, and I believe it has happened.

But I don't see how this is relevant at all to this discussion:

* if they are not really FLG believers, they should be prosecuted, but this says nothing about the real FLG believers,
* if they are, then why wouldn't they seek a VISA, since they are in constant threat of going to jail or worse in China, and the USA law gives them that right?

[[flg-witness]]
=== I have personally seen people do bad things because of Falun Gong

Either direct suicide or <<flg-medication,dying because of not taking medication>>.

First, I'm not saying I don't believe you, and I'm sorry about what happened.

But your testimony is worthless unless you give the following:

* clear unique personal identification
+
This is because the CCP has thousands of <<wumao,wumaos>> who could make fake reports.
+
There are basically two ways to do that:
+
. your testimony is done in video form on YouTube clearly showing your face as you make it
. links between a notable social media presence that is hard to achieve, e.g. Twitter with many followers, Stack overflow with a lot of rep, and the account
+
Either of those must contain / link to information that uniquely identifies you. Generally, full name, city and date of birth is enough.
* a precise testimony that states exactly what you saw happen with your own eyes, or heard from people that are very close to you.
+
The testimony must include:
+
--
** when the events happened
** where they happened, in which city at the very least
** the full names of who did what
--
+
This is to:
+
** make it easier to verify the truth of the event
** uniquely identify the event so we don't count a single event multiple times

If you do provide all of the above, I add your report to a list of reports that I will maintain. This list does not exist yet because there were no valid reports yet.

Next consider this:

* are you sure that Falun Gong made the person do the bad thing, and that the person wouldn't have done it anyway?
+
Did someone from Falun Gong told the person to do it?
+
I bet that if you look into patients of psychiatrists, you will find more suicides than average. So should we ban psychiatry?
* are you sure that the order came from <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>>, and that it was not just some disgruntled local leader using Falun Gong for his personal madness and doing things he did not approve?
+
Branch Davidians were inspired by <<christianity>>. So should we ban Christianity? What about the majority of Christians who have never done anything bad?
* only statistics have any meaning, and it would require a very large number of reports to make up statistics, so you will likely be wasting your time. I will do my part and maintain a list however.
* if we ask for FLG believers to compile a list of horrors they have suffered, which they have already been doing since the start of the persecution, I bet that their list will be much longer than yours, because they are so <<flg-organized,well organized>>

[[flg-persecution]]
=== Falun Gong does not have proof of their persecution claims (法轮功没有被迫害的证据)

How much proof do you think they would be able to get when there is no freedom of the press?

Do you think that forbidding a <<flg-important,70 million>> person religion could have gone smoothly?

Do you think the thousands of personal accounts of human rights violations that exist are all fake, and don't indicate that many, many more have taken place but fallen under censorship?

Conversely, there is no reliable proof that FLG is bad as claimed by CCP that has been verified by international media.

[[western-media-has-exaggerated-reports-on-falun-gong-for-propaganda-reasons]]
==== Western media has exaggerated reports on Falun Gong for propaganda reasons (西方媒体以宣传为由夸大法轮功报道)

Possibly true, but which reports are you talking about specifically?

All that I care about is:

* it is censored today
* if you do it you go to jail
* there were tens of millions of followers at the time of the ban

which I think are undeniable.

The only question that matters is: should it be banned or not?

And as usual: <<censorship-makes-no-one-trust-your-country>>, so which reports can we trust more?

=== Someone from movement X did something bad, therefore the movement should be banned (X运动中的某个人做了坏事，因此该运动应该被禁止)

By this logic, everyone should go to jail. The law should only punish individuals.

The communist party, which has had continuous power since 1949, killed millions during the <<cultural-revolution>>. Surely they must be banned, no?

But the CCP has changed so much since those days, <<ciro-santilli>> hears you say.

Ciro agrees. And <<flg-changed,so has Falun Gong>>.

As https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_in_China&oldid=992138770#History[mentioned on Wikipedia], China has a long history of suicide for altruistic/moral/honour reasons in Confucian tradition, some of which are still celebrated to this day.

The <<analects>> paragraph <<analects-translation-by-robert-eno-2015,15.9>> says:

<<mencius-book>> paragraph <<mencius-translation-by-robert-eno-2016,paragraph 6A.10>> says:

I love to eat fish; I also love to eat bear paws. If I can't have both, I will forego the fish and eat the bear paws. I love life; I also love right. If I can't have both, I will forego life and choose to do right. Life is truly something I love, it is just that there is something else I love more, and so I can't hold on to life by devious means. And death is truly something I hate, it is just that there is something I hate more than death, and so there are dangers I will not avoid.

If a man loves nothing more than life, then won't he use whatever means are required to hold onto it? If a man hates nothing more than death, then won't he use whatever means are required to avoid danger? Yet there are things men won't do in order to avoid danger and live, and from this we know that there are things men love more than life and hate more than death. It is not just worthy men who have such feelings, all men have them; worthies are simply those who do not lose them.

[[flg-political]]
=== People from movement X are only in it for political power (X运动的人只是为了政治权力)

For every desire of the masses, there will be amoral representatives that will step to use that power.

Still, those representatives cannot gain power if there is no backing desire from society.

The only advantage of <<richer,democracy>>, is that those representatives have to pretend harder to do things for that group to retain their power.

Falun Gong believers obviously have the right to do politics, just like any other person, and Ciro greatly encourages this.

But Ciro does not like that Falun Gong tends to not call itself a political force, when it clearly is. But full disclosure is not a legal obligation, and many many media outlets don't really disclose their obvious political connections. See also: <<flg-transparent>>.

Falun Gong directly contacts Government officials, http://www.clearharmony.net/articles/a25124-European-Falun-Gong-Practitioners-held-an-Anti-torture-Exhibition-during-the-European-Union-Meeting-in-France.html#.XyHSa2OYWV4[demonstrates in front of government buildings] and <<flg-trump,supports Trump>>, how can that not be politics?!?! Just call it for what it is, and no one will be able to criticize you for it!

<<li-hongzhi>> directly says that FLG should not be involved in politics in <<flg-canon>>, e.g. https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/jjyz52.htm[]:

____
Never get involved in politics, nor interfere with state affairs'.
____

But at the same, he also greatly encourages <<falun-gong-media>>, which obviously a political influence method. As usual, everything in Falun Gong is explained in an indirect roundabout way.

Other related canon mentions https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2003/3/21/33575.html "Explaining the Fa During the 2003 Lantern Festival at the U.S. West Fa Conference":

____
Question: When elections were held in our district, there were people who went to help a few congressional candidates that supported Dafa. But some people thought we shouldn't get ourselves involved in politics, and that we shouldn't rely on ordinary people to do things for Dafa. Is that understanding correct?

Teacher: It's correct in principle, but for this specific matter you should look at it this way. If you say Dafa disciples can't get involved in ordinary society's politics, I wouldn't say that's 100% correct. What I told you was that Dafa doesn't get involved in politics. And a lot of our Dafa disciples work in politics, that's their job. So if there's a government election, should you take part in it? If you take part in it and cast your vote, well then you've gotten involved in politics. A Dafa disciple cultivating in the ordinary society means that you try your best to cultivate while conforming to the ordinary society, and then there won't be a problem. You, too, are a member of the ordinary society. And the existence of the ordinary society is necessary for Dafa, for the cosmos, and for sentient beings. We can only help maintain it and can't disrupt it. When you're supposed to vote, just go vote, that's not a problem. If you say that a certain Congressman is your personal friend, and you'd like to help him do something, then of course there might be things that involve elections and you'd be doing volunteer work—that doesn't matter. But our Dafa as a whole doesn't get involved in politics, and we can't do anything political in the name of Dafa. For Dafa disciples, validating the Fa should be the priority, though.

The last time there was an election in Taiwan, I had a veteran practitioner call the person in charge of the Taiwan Dafa Association and make it clear to the public that Dafa Associations take no stance on elections. If an individual practitioner wants to support someone, that's his personal business and it doesn't represent Dafa. There were Dafa disciples supporting both of the parties. The Falun Dafa Association has no political opinion regarding any party's election, and it doesn't get involved. As individual practitioners you can support whoever you'd like. That's how it works.
____

The last paragraph is really great, as it indicates how Li's communication works. His top tenants are known, and their word is as good as the master's.

https://en.falundafa.org/eng/lectures/20040412L.html[] also has some good quotes:

____
Question: During Taiwan's presidential election, some students' human attachments got stirred up. Was it a test arranged by the old forces? What's the right way for us to handle this?

Teacher: Even if the sky were to fall, a cultivator's righteous thoughts would stay unshaken--that is cultivation, and that is remarkable. (Applause) A cultivator is not attached to anything in this world. Dafa disciples' cultivation takes a different form today. In cultivation you do your best out in the world to conform to ordinary society, you have normal jobs in ordinary society, and you have your families, jobs, and all that--you are closely tied to society. With the Taiwan election, some students thought a certain person was pretty good and so they wanted to vote for him, while others thought a different person was pretty good and wanted to vote for that one. People have their own, different views, and there's nothing wrong with that. A person's own actions out in society don't represent Dafa. But you can't be attached to those things the way ordinary people are.

Whoever you vote for, I can't, as your Master, say that you're wrong, nor do I get involved in those things. That's because the path I ask you to take has you cultivate in ordinary society. Cultivators can only benefit a society. You cultivate in ordinary society but you don't steer human society in one direction or another.

So for each student, it's fine for you to vote as an individual for whomever you want. It's just that you can't be too attached. But through the persecution against Dafa disciples in Mainland China, Dafa disciples have seen through something, and so some are thinking, "Whoever is close to the evil that's persecuting us, I won't vote for him." (Applause) And as your Master I have no objection to that either. (Audience laughs, applauds) Those are the students' own thoughts, and as your Master I haven't told you who to vote for. Still less will I tell you to take any group action, and that's not allowed. (Audience laughs)

Schmalz] said on this VICE documentary about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyung_Jin_Moon[Hyung Jin Moon]'s and his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_movement[Unification movement] ("the Moonies" split-off religion. "I think that any new religion needs a constituency. And especially for a group that is new, that is relatively small, making connections with other groups that might have similar commitments is something that can be quite productive if you are a leader of a new religion". As long as everyone plays the democracy game through democracy rules, peace tends to be maintained, and it is easier for multiple different beliefs to coexist. Falun Gong has obviously gone in this political direction, and that is a positive sign about the religion.

[[flg-trump]]
==== Falun Gong supports Donald (Trump, 法轮功支持特朗普)

<<ciro-santilli>> believes without non-circumstantial evidence that the huge majority of Falun Gong believers strongly supports Trump.

Ciro feels that Falun Gong's support of Trump is a fundamental religious issue to the group.

Falun Gong seems to believe that Trump is perfect and that everything that he says is true and good. He is essentially a supernatural force of good, as well shown at: <<you-are-not-alone-by-tony-chen-music>>. And his opponents, e.g. Biden and the Left, are the opposite.

Like everything else concrete, it is not clear if <<li-hongzhi>> has directly supported this or not.

Ciro feels without proof however that it is extremely likely that he has given very clear private directives to his top tenants to support Trump, notably to the heads of the key <<falun-gong-media>> organizations.

And then this belief gets pumped endlessly through the Falun Gong media, which completely unilaterally praises and supports Trump and criticizes his opponents, so that all believers understand that this is Li Hongzhi's desire.

Edit: around 2021-05-15, this got published on <<minghui>>: https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2021/5/18/大纪元新唐人媒体法会讲法-425888.html[]. It is not on <<flg-canon,falundafa.org>> yet, but is extremely likely to be uploaded later and can already be consiered canon. The title is "Fa Teachings at the <<epoch-times>>/<<ntdtv>> media meeting", and it contains the first, unumbiguous support of Trump done in Canon. Although such support took a long time to come out publicly in canon, <<flg-transparent,which ciro-santilli condems>>, it was a huge positive step forward towards transparency, as it makes Falun Gong's pre-exising but unannounced religious support for Donald trump publicly official. The key quote on Google Translate is:

____
Everyone knows that the former president of the United States could not be re-elected, and he was taken down by improper means. I only talk about this phenomenon. Isn't it a manifestation of the current state of society? Everyone knows that the former president wants to talk about traditions and restore traditions. What he has to do is to change the moral quality of people and society in a better direction, and to restore society to a better social state. Is he going against the current heavenly principle? Because God's law is not working. Is he against the trend of this society? He is going against the current, and he wants to suffocate the current. If it's a country, maybe he can do it; what about the entire human society, it's too difficult. So, if the entire universe is like this, can it be intercepted? Unstoppable. So, those gods who took him down and those bad gods in the old universe were as timid as they had stolen things in their hearts. They knew what he was doing was good. Do not you know? all know. Although those gods are corrupt, at least he still understands these things
____

which therefore clearly says Trump is a manifestation of supernatural forces of good, and also clearly says that the 2020 American election was in fact https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election[stolen by the Democrats as per Donald Trump's accusations].

It could have been even more direct, but <<ciro-santilli>> considers this more than direct enough. A Brazillian saying comes to mind: "Para bom entendedor, meia palavra basta" (For the Connoisseur/Expert, half a word is enough). This was notably used as part of an relentless advertisement campain when Ciro was young (certainly too young to drink) for the overly-long-named beer brand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil_Kirin[Schincariol], suggesting that you could just call is "schin", e.g. to order it at a bar. Sample ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-UWr1RIQU[]. Anyways, back to Falun Gong, when it is the word of <<li-hongzhi,Living God himself>>, even a quarter-word is enough I guess.

Prior to that, the most direct public suggestion we can find that Li Hongzhi directly supported Trump was in 2020-11-08 https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/11/8/n12534746.htm when the <<epoch-times>> published a poem by <<li-hongzhi>> which Ciro believes is clearly directly supporting Trump, since it was released just after Trump was announced to have lost the presidential elections, amidst claims of electoral fraud under investigation, which Falun Gong media fully and completely supported. The official translation can be found in <<flg-canon>> https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20201108A.html[]:

____

To be completely fair, Trump has been vocal about China's threat way before <<covid,COVID>>, and correctly so in Ciro's opinion, and therefore is a much needed ally of the Falun Gong movement, and to anyone that opposes China's threat, like Ciro does.

Furthermore, Ciro does believe that there might be a Democrat bias to media, and that certainly <<hate-speech,social media like Twitter should never ever censor any political statements as it has done for Trump>>.

And of course, so long as those pro-Trump campaigns respect the laws of the country, Falun Gong is free to do it and must not be interfered with. As if other major American media didn't have political agendas: <<usa-based-media-bias>>.

This is exactly the same, in fact, as to how <<flg-religion,religious affiliation>> has a huge impact in how the average American votes: https://theconversation.com/how-strong-a-role-does-religion-play-in-us-elections-133224[].

It seems that Trump's immigration policies have turned Asian Americans towards the democrat opposition however as of 2019: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/13/18308137/asian-american-voters-immigration-democrats-donald-trump[].

One saving point of the republicans for Asians is the opposition to university quotas instance, which many Asians feel blocks their high performing kids from top schools for less deserving students. This is suggested for example at: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/yang-asian-americans-affirmative-action/605917/ "Opposition to affirmative action was pulling Asians toward the GOP. Then Yang's campaign began to gather momentum."

Examples:

* NBC News claims that the <<epoch-times>> has donated to Trump propaganda: $1.5 million https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-qanon-impending-judgment-day-behind-facebook-fueled-rise-epoch-n1044121
* after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election[2020 United States presidential election], <<falun-gong-media>> such as <<epoch-times>> was one of the very few medias to not immediately dismiss https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election[Trump's accusations of electoral fraud], as baseless e.g. on 2020-12-12 https://web.archive.org/web/20201212014230/https://www.theepochtimes.com/ the front page read "Election outcome unclear amid legal challenges", at which point most had been shot down. And earlier their editorial had clarified https://web.archive.org/web/20201107223813/https://www.theepochtimes.com/[] "Why The Epoch Times Won't Call the Presidential Race Until All Challenges Are Resolved".
** 2020-12-16 consider this sample <<ntdtv>> screenshot of the latest videos published at the time: https://archive.vn/Sxn8m[], where it can be seen that about 80-90% of the videos are supporting Trump's electoral fraud claims.
+
While Ciro agrees that reporting such events impartially is important and has merit, the fact that so few medias took the lawsuits seriously at all is still indicative of their strong Trump support.
+
Ciro is also extremely opposed to censorship of such viewpoints, as done by YouTube, as mentioned at <<fake-news>>, when they started taking down any videos that upheld the electoral fraud viewpoint.

Many people didn't expect Trump to be elected in the last U.S. election, but he was. Some people believe that things are supposed to go a certain way, but then they turn out otherwise. I have always said that divine beings are in control of human affairs, and that it is they who have the say. But if I speak too much about it or get into the specifics, it might negatively impact our saving people, so I won't go into it.
____

As usual, Hongzhi beats round the bush, as per <<different-levels-of-truth>>. Ciro feels it <<flg-transparent,would be better for Falun Gong if he just publicly said that believers must support Trump>>.

One wonders how Falun Gong views Trump's ideology of "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape[grabbing them by the pussy]". But sure, that was in 2005, he must have converted to Good since.

This is consistent with Ciro's understanding of FLG's view of the world, where <<falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils>> ("I see the true light - You are the Chosen One to fight the Red Demon") and therefore Trump is the manifestation of a supernatural force oof Good. The Chinese version is even more open about Trump's God-like status: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZrVbX8jV_o[], and contains perls such as (official translation) "I see hope - you are the Chosen One to save the world" and "Trump, Trump, you are not alone! Gods and Buddhas are here with you!". The extensive use of Trump's slogan "Make America great again" is also in line with Falun Gong's belief that the world was Good before, but has become Evil today. <<epoch-times>> made a https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/18/2/1/n10105396.htm[profile of Tony in 2018].

=== Does Ciro Santilli believe in the allegations of human rights violations done to Falun Gong believers?

Besides the obvious prohibition of their most fundamental belief, so e.g. being tortured.

Let's just focus on the evidence:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CedVnJOgwg4 "Undercover video reveals brutal treatment of Falun Gong prisoners inside Chinese labor camps" by "FOX 11 Los Angeles" published May 21, 2019. Names mentioned: Fuquan Yin,

[[flg-organ-harvesting]]
==== Does Ciro Santilli believe in the allegations of organ harvesting made by Falun Gong believers?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/對中國共產黨摘取法輪功學員及良心犯器官的指控

In short: Ciro believes that it has happened to many people.

Long version follows.

It is obviously very hard to prove and quantify it definitely, much like it was hard to prove the Holocaust: bodies were cremated, and bribes were paid.

Even if we had a video showing the whole process, showing the whole money flow from the donor to the prison guard, it would still be hard to quantify it, so I do have some room for doubt in this opinion.

But consider the following, which is based on what Ciro has heard.

Even Chinese officials have admitted that in the past, if the body of the executed person is not claimed by family, then the organs can be extracted even without the consent of the prisoner:

* 2014-12-04 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-30324440 "China to stop harvesting executed prisoners' organs"
* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/china-still-using-executed-prisoners-organs-transplants-vatican
* https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-the-face-of-criticism-china-has-been-cleaning-up-its-organ-transplant-industry/2017/09/14/d689444e-e1a2-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html

Perhaps now that they claim that there is a large voluntary organ donor database, then this has stopped or been reduced, but let's focus on that period when the extractions were widely done.

From this, even though China does not publish execution statistics, we can imagine that a large part of the organs come from prisoners sentenced to death.

Then, consider that a <<flg-important,70 million>> person religion was banned, leading to a huge influx of prisoners from that religion.

FLG followers are just de-facto criminals like any other, and so extracting their organs is also de-facto legal.

Also, people from that religion don't drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs, and their organs are of good quality.

Furthermore, FLG prisoners continue to not bow down to the government even in prison, e.g. by doing their <<flg-religion,Falun Gong meditation>>, which makes them clearly identifiable and dangerous to the system.

Finally, add to that mix the <<corruption,huge level of corruption found in dictatorships>>.

Don't you think, then, that it is extremely likely that it has happened many times that such people have been selected to be executed earlier than others on average, due to the monetary value of their organs?

This is a mock tribunal, i.e. one without any power of law, and was of course initially lobbied/organized brought up by FLG: https://endtransplantabuse.org/

However, Ciro Santilli believes that none of the lawyers/jury members are Falun Gong believers, and that they are trying to honestly decide if there is enough evidence or not for organ harvesting in China.

They also have non-FLG witnesses.

[[things-ciro-santilli-dislikes-about-falun-gong]]
=== Things Ciro Santilli dislikes about Falun Gong (三西猴不喜欢法轮功的事情)

But also as explaining why I don't think it justifies the ban.

This section also gives me more credibility as a balanced critic >:-)

* <<flg-religion,Falun Gong downplays the fact that they are a religion>>

[[flg-organized]]
==== Falun Gong downplays the fact that it is highly organized (法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)

Many FLG practitioners claim that they are not at all organized, or that they have no political interest, and I truly believe that they mean it.

But it is obvious from the size of the <<falun-gong-media>>, namely:

* <<ntdtv>>
* <<epoch-times>> newspaper
* <<shen-yun>> dance troupe

that in practice they do have are a highly organized hierarchical structure, and very likely with <<li-hongzhi,LHZ>> at the very top, e.g.:

* Shen Yun's 2018 libretto says that their Artistic Director and founder is "D.F." (likely an abbreviation for Da Fa, which is an abbreviation for Falun Gong Dafa, which is a full name of Falun Gong), with a picture of LHZ on top. It also amusingly says that D.F. is a "Distinguished Professor of Music and Dance at Fei Tian College in New York", which is likely where many of Shen Yun's dancers are trained, and therefore controlled by himself to a large extent. It's Falun Gong's dance-only-for-now https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University[BYU].
* LHZ mentions NDTV, Epoch Times and Shen Yun extensively on his <<flg-canon>>. TODO link to source, this based on unintentionally overhearing to my family members reading it.

Furthermore, Falun Gong practitioners directly lobby foreign governments to take action against human rights abuses in China, e.g.:

* https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+P7-RC-2013-0562+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN
* https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-court-cisco-must-be-held-accountable-aiding-chinas-human-rights-abuses

Like any other religion, they have all the right to take those actions, and it is definitely in their best interest, and perhaps in the best interest of the whole world, that they do so.

The only thing that annoys me is their lack of self perception on this matter: the large majority of Western people would definitely classify them as an organized political force after having observed their activities. When they say otherwise, they are hurting their own credibility.

[[flg-transparent]]
===== Falun Gong media is not transparent about its affiliation (法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)

Agreed, and it is a point that hurts more than helps their cause.

This is very clearly put as well at "Front groups" of the <<orange-papers>>.

But the media is not legally obliged to state their affiliation.

And if that were the case, then we should force _all_ newspapers to start taking polls of how many employees follow which religion and support which political party, and then put that in their print.

But <<xinhua>> is learning well from this, e.g. <<new-china-tv>>.

[[flg-intolerance]]
==== Falun Gong dislikes several other groups like homosexuals and some other religions (法轮功不喜欢其他几个群体，如同性恋者和其他一些宗教)

Like most <<flg-religion,old religions>>, related: <<hate-speech>>.

<<flg-canon,Canon quote>> from https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980904L.html[]:

____
Question: Why is homosexuality considered immoral?

Teacher: Think about it, everyone: Is homosexuality human behavior? Heaven created man and woman. What was the purpose? To procreate future generations. A man being with a man, or a woman with a woman - it doesn't take much thought to know whether that's right or wrong. When minor things are done incorrectly, a person is said to be wrong. When major things are done incorrectly, it's a case of people no longer having the moral code of human beings, and then they are unworthy of being human.
____

<<ciro-santilli>> strongly disagrees with that view, because it is the type of thing that makes people feel bad for characteristics that they have, but cannot change.

Also, it is very hard to pass any kind of law that forces people not to be racist/discriminatory, because there is always the lingering question: what if they are right about a particular point?

Because clearly everyone has innate characteristics that make them better suited for certain activities than others, we when we select candidates for a job, we are basically discriminating amongst candidates.

Also any such law can have the opposite effect, acting as a justification for further hate.

You and I dislike certain personality traits without any logical reason.

Democracy dislikes dictators, and it is not necessarily rational.

===== Falun Gong on races

<<li-hongzhi>> clearly classifies races as a metaphysical concept e.g. on <<flg-canon>> https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990502L.html[]:

____
Strictly speaking, Indians, Egyptians, Persians, the yellow race, the white race, and the black race are the six major races of the present Earth. All the other ones are mixed races.

Teacher: He has lost the body that comes from the top down through to here. Let me put it this way: People of the yellow race have people of the yellow race up there, and people of the white race have people of the white race up there. He's lost this thread.

Question: Can a person of mixed race succeed in cultivation?

Teacher: Whether someone can cultivate and whether he can succeed in cultivation are all up to the person himself. If a person of mixed race can persist in cultivation, he can reach Consummation just the same. When he succeeds in cultivation his Primordial Spirit will return to wherever he came from.

[[flg-medication]]
==== Falun Gong believers are less likely to take necessary medication (法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物)

Based on what <<ciro-santilli>> saw and heard, he does believe, without any clear statistical evidence, that it is very likely that it hs happened to in many cases that some Falun Gong believers refused to take modern medications and died of diseases that could be otherwise cured.

But consider the following:

* what matters are statistics. Maybe FLG people live longer than non FLG in average. But we will never have statistics because of censorship: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27529/have-many-falun-gong-practitioners-forgone-medical-treatment-and-died-of-treatab
* maybe people should be link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation[allowed to choose how they want to die], and not to take medication if they don't want to
+
As the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation[Parks and Recreation] caricaturally liberal character https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson[Ron Swanson] puts it https://youtu.be/_UlNnETAZeI?t=48[about the United States]:
+
____
The whole point of this country is if you wanna eat garbage, balloon up to six hundred pounds and die of a heart attack at forty three, you can! You are free to do so. To me that's beautiful.
____
+
<<freedom-with-a-capital-f>> also comes to mind.
* maybe the number of people killed during persecution vastly outnumbers those who died because they would not take medication
* several <<flg-religion,religions>>, including <<christianity>> have miraculous cure claims. My impression is that claims were mostly notable in the old times apparently, likely because people noticed that Christians were still dying of all kinds of diseases like everyone else, no matter how devout!
* maybe the main reason why communists banned Falun Gong is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well? See also <<rule-of-law>>.
* maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication
* maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication. But their religion was banned anyway. Who can agree and follow all the innumerable prescriptions of any religious or legal system? See also: <<flg-thoughtcrime>>.
* all the following also reduce people's lifespan:
+
--
** riding motorcycles vs. cars/buses
** smoking
** moving to a poor country to do charity there
** eating fast food
--
+
Forbidding them also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...). So why not forbid them as well?

Especially In the beginning, Falun Gong did put a lot of emphasis on its health benefits, just <<zhong-gong,like all the other contemporaneous Qi Gong practices>>, and it is likely that especially many in the first generation of believers do believe it more than others.

For example, the main initial public announcement of Falun Gong was at a <<history-of-falun-gong,Health Exposition in Beijing>>.

In <<flg-canon>> itself, this is not super explicit and emphasised as far as Ciro can see. Zhuan Falun https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_74.htm[] has a chapter entitled "On the Issue of Healing Illnesses", that contains:

____
 Let us talk about the most common illnesses, like tumors, infections or osteoproliferation etc., found in the human body. In another space, a very deep space, there lies an evil intelligent entity.
____

and the general very beaty-around-the-bush suggestion that if you do master Falun Gong fully, you will be healthy. But with the usual disclaimer that "you have to become a master", and since "there are no graduates", no one is ever a master for sure, and as usual "you don't get the promised goodies", as as mentioned at: <<orange-papers>>.

https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/mgjf.htm contains some more direct quotes that suggest that you can take medicine, but you have to try and bear the pain first, and if you can't, it's a sign that you haven't practiced Falun Gong well enough:

____
So when you take medicine now you're killing this sickness or the virus at the surface. Medicine can truly kill viruses at the surface. Yet a practitioner's gong[7] is automatically destroying viruses and karma. But as soon as medicine kills the surface virus that has seeped over from other dimensions, the virus—karma—over on the other side will know, since everything is alive, and it will stop coming over. Then you feel that you've recovered because you took the medicine. But let me tell you that it nonetheless accumulates over there. Life after life human beings are accumulating this stuff. When the accumulation reaches a certain extent, the person becomes incurable and when he dies he's totally destroyed. He loses his life—forever loses his life. That's how horrifying it is. So here I've explained to you the relationship. It's not that people aren't allowed to take medicine. When an everyday person gets sick he definitely needs medical treatment.

But how do we cultivators deal with it? Aren't we purifying your body? Like the annual rings of a tree, there is karma at the very core, and at every layer, life after life, of your body. When you practice cultivation, I keep pushing this karma outward from the center; I push, and push, and push, and push until I completely push the karma out for you. And not all of this can go through the surface of our bodies. You wouldn't be able to bear it if all of it were to go through the surface of your body. Only a portion of it comes out through the surface. But you still feel that you're suddenly getting sick, you find it terribly uncomfortable and painful, can't bear it, regard yourself as an everyday person, and go take medicine. Then you can go ahead and take medicine, as we've never said that everyday people can't take medicine. We only say that your enlightenment quality isn't up to par and that you didn't pass this test well.
____

Ciro does however believe that newer generations believe in this much less, notably because the first believer generation is all basically old or dead, and soon will be entirely dead. This might also have been de-emphasised to reduce the bullshit aspects and help the international spread of Falun Gong. Not even Falun Gong believers are that blind. And this perfectly mimics the beginning of Christianism, where the first generations gave much more emphasis to miraculous cures.

<<me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-2017>> has an anecdote on this, which Ciro feels sounds believable:

[[me-and-li-tumor]]
____
I think it was Lynn's* death that finally made me realise it was time to leave. I'd seen the writing on the wall about a year prior when I saw her at a yearly "Fa conference" for believers of Falun Gong, otherwise known as Falun Dafa, to exchange experiences and grow spiritually together. An executive assistant at a Queensland valuation firm, I'd gotten to know her over the years in various events as a warm and level-headed lady who had time for everyone. But I'd noticed she had developed a bulge on the side of her head and I was trying not to look at it when I talked to her. I saw, or at least I believed I saw, some pain in her smile. She was probably questioning herself over and over again what "attachments" she hadn't let go of that were causing this sickness to spread through her body and endanger her life. I wanted to tell her to just go to a hospital, although I wasn't at this stage resolute enough in my gradual return to logic. Another part of me feared that by looking at it I was acknowledging it — something you don't do with illnesses in Falun Gong because Master Li Hongzhi teaches that his pupils don't get illnesses. He can cure you but only if you don't have any loopholes in your belief in him and his teachings. Some people with solid beliefs can actually die due to others around them having flaws in their thinking, Li says. Just thinking the wrong way is perilous when you're a Falun Gong practitioner.

I later heard through the grapevine of Lynn's death. The cancer went into her brain and she passed away in extreme pain, probably believing to the end that it was her fault she was in this awful predicament. In a way, I guess it was.
____

and more interesting anecdotes follow, see source.

And Ciro has felt this first hand with his <<wife,mother-in-law>>. Whenever she has a health worry, first she tries to hide it. But then she casually mentions it without much thought because she speaks all the time the poor lady, may she be blessed. And then, when Ciro says: OK, let's try and treat it, even for trivial things that might have simple treatments, she immediately smiles a compassionate smile of "I'm a Falun Gong believer, I don't need that". This makes Ciro really mad. He tries to not show it, because he thinks people should be able to choose how they die. But Li promises the powers of <<flg-cross-dimensional-vision,remote, cross dimensional and past/future vision>> to some believers, and yet, blinds some of them to the obvious fact that they are aging, and, slowly but surely, their own bodies are starting to fail, like everyone else's will at one point.

It is also interesting to note how the Chinese government itself supported Falun Gong and <<zhong-gong,other Qi Gong practices>> for their health benefits, which is why they grew so large in the first place. <<li-hongzhi>> was even <<history-of-falun-gong,awarded prizes and recognized as a Qi Gong master by state backed organizations in 1992 and 1993>>. And the CCP still has a tendency to support certain non-scientific traditional practices: <<support-for-non-scientific-traditional-practices>>.

[[freedom-with-a-capital-f]]

[[falun-gongs-view-of-epidemics]]
===== Falun Gong's view of epidemics (法轮功的流行病观)

<<li-hongzhi>> has said in <<flg-canon,canon>> things that lead certain believers (including e.g. <<wife,Ciro's mother in law>>) to believe that because they are good Falun Gong believers, that they are more safe from disease from evil people.

For example, in the 2003 "Fa conference" at the time of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome[SARS] he https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20030420L.html[said]:

____
You must have seen the epidemic that's come along in China now, right? Hasn't a huge epidemic arrived? To put it in human terms, it's Heaven punishing people. What it's targeting, we Dafa disciples know full well: it's targeting those who don't deserve to be saved, who are impossible to save while Dafa disciples clarify the truth, and who aren't useful to the evil rotten spirits. This is the first round of cleansing. Heaven is punishing the evil, yet China is still lying to cover up the number of deaths, and I'll tell you, it's huge, and it hasn't peaked yet.
____

Such beliefs have of course carried over directly to <<covid,COVID-19>>. Of course, epidemics make the moral question much more difficult, because not taking care of yourself means you can kill others besides yourself.

An amazing quote from https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/20/183715.html[]:

____
Stay Rational

Pandemics and plagues are part of a divine plan and inevitable in the course of history.
____

Stay rational. Believe in God ;-)

Epidemics are also likely moments where religious grow due to more people being more desperate and looking for solace that cannot be found in this shitty world.

It is indeed tempting to believe that the virus magically kills only the Evil. What reality could be so fucked up where the innocent suffocate to their death? And yet, here we are.

[[falun-gong-liturgical-calendar]]
==== Falun Gong liturgical calendar (法轮功教会年历)

Exactly like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical_year[other religions], Falun Gong has some important dates that are celebrated to keep believers engaged. Those are:

* May 13th: <<li-hongzhi>>'s claimed birthday, although the Chinese government and some scholars disagree with that date, which suspicioiusly seems to coincide with the Buddha's birthdate
+
Also known as "Dafa Day".
+
The international Falun Gong conference, usually called just "Fa Conference" (法会), also happens around that date in New York, the state where Li Hongzhi lives in <<dragon-springs>> for the same reason, e.g. in 2019 it was on May 17 https://www.ntd.com/over-10000-share-stories-of-self-improvement-at-falun-dafa-conference_331440.html
+
There are other more local Fa conferences held throughout the year however also.

[[li-hongzhi]]
==== Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/李洪志

Li Hongzhi is the creator of <<falun-gong>>: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi[].

Falun Gong people call him "master" (师父), which is a common traditional term used to respectfully address experienced teachers in a disciple (弟子)/teacher relation, e.g. Kung Fu or other crafts.

However they also believe that he has many many God-like powers and is comparable figures such as Jesus and Buddha himself.

Notably they believe that he has superpowers, and that everything that he says is the absolute truth of the universe, see also: <<flg-religion>>.

The term "master" is also used for example in the fictional film The Master (2012), which is likely inspired in <<flg-religion,Scientology>>.

<<ciro-santilli>> however prefers to call him <<flg-religion,prophet>>, since he feels LHZ is indistinguishable from <<flg-religion,any other religion>>. Guru/<<flg-cult,cult leader>> could also apply.

It's funny that even though Falun Gong only came up recently in the 80's, we still know relatively little about Li. One is kind of reminded of Jesus! See also <<li-hongzhis-family>> and <<li-hongzhis-hagiography>>.

One should note however that this is partly by design: at some point in the 90's, Li relatively stepped away from public view. This is because once you reach a critical mass of followers, it is better to let them to the preaching for you, while you hide your obvious human defects in a corner. See also comments at <<vissarion,Vissarion>>.

[[falun-gong-is-dangerous-because-li-hongzhi-has-too-much-power-over-followers]]
===== Falun Gong is dangerous because Li Hongzhi has too much power over followers (法轮功是危险的，因为李洪志对追随者的权力太大)

Ciro agrees that there is danger in every religion, and especially new religions.

However the same point can be made about political parties and in particular the CCP and its chairman.

Couldn't a charismatic leader chairman gain more and more power (like Xi seems to be doing), and eventually start a war and kill millions? Or just kill some minority who is not happy about the situation.

Similarly, any charismatic leader of a pro-democracy movement could become the leader of a terrorist organization.

If you ever want democracy, you will have to learn to accept the beliefs of others, and only punish them when they actually break a law.

Finally, LHZ was born in 1951, so he will die in 20 years, unless FLG is true and a miracle happens, and then this argument will become invalid.

From what Ciro hears, LHZ has always maintained that he is the only source of truth on FLG (see also "The Guru is always right"), and therefore, so his death will very likely remove any danger once and for all.

Furthermore, it also seems to Ciro that FLG is clearly anti-violence and self-harm, so Ciro wonder how many would follow a contradictory order such as killing or suicide? We have had no hint of any incitation to violence so far.

It is also interesting to look into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown case. When the suicide order came, most people wanted out! Without physically controlling the followers, I don't think you can make them do much.

[[let-s-make-a-mini-series-about-li-hongzhi-s-life]]
===== Let's make a mini series about Li Hongzhi's life (让我们制作一个关于李洪志生平的迷你系列)

Ciro can't help but to imagine how Falun Gong came about in detail.

Someone should write a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(novel)["The Last Temptation of Christ"].

This deserves an American miniseries like Chernobyl.

It would manage to piss off both FLG and the CCP, which would be amazing. It is a shame that it is so difficult to find good historical information between the infinite barrages of CCP and FLG propaganda.

It could show how:

* Li was an ordinary dude who could liked to play the trumpet, which partially explains his focus on <<falun-gong-media,Shen Yun>> and Falun Gong musical street parades
* Li first heard about Qi Gong, and went to practice it under some dude. Then how he saw other people were so into it, and decided to take this opportunity to make a career out of it during the 80's
* how he met his wife and had a daughter
* how he started to notice how people were feeling things during the exercise classes, and started suggesting more and more metaphysics to these first disciples
* Li could also have some metaphysical moment, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW20LbwAmng but at the same time, he must tell his followers some lies which he does not believe
* how followers started telling others things and "experience sharing" where the cycle of belief stats to take off
* a clear demonstration of how "A group of early adopters in Changchun became disenchanted after Li forbade his followers from charging fees for the practice at the end of 1994" showing dissent within the cult
* and finally, the immigration and crackdown, and how he put his fingers on those things, and the creation of media, this could be the last episode

Episodes could be split along:

* Episode 1: pre Qi Gong, shows Childhood, workplaces, early motivations. Ends with first contact with a Qi Gong lesson
* Episode 2: early Falun Gong. Opens an academy. Starts without metaphysics, but grows into it. Show him knowingly lying, but also seething magic things. The first followers, and top lieutenants. Makes some management mistake, but gets away with it. Could end in a metaphysical scene, or 13 May 1992 initial public lesson. Maybe a scene of Li's visit to <<thailand>> in 1983 (photo from CCP media found on Google).
* Episode 3: later Falun Gong in China. It grows, show in Chinese news. Power struggles, problems with early lieutenants, and new lieutenants come up. Many people practice on streets. Battle against <<zhong-gong>>. Near 1996, something tips Li off to the fact that the CCP is going to crack down on them, and so he announces that he will be spreading abroad full time. Check out if this was before or after the first Anti FLG newspaper article in 1996-06-17.
* Episode 4: preaching outside of China and emigration. American permanent residence in 1998. Watches crackdown on television. International Falun Gong media. Show him at Falun Gong New York <<dragon-springs,"Dragon Springs">> complex

Or maybe, never mind that boring post 1992 stuff which is already highly public, instead we could focus only on the more interesting pre-1992 events, and finish in 1992.

So per-early FLG up to 1992, with childhood flashbacks.

The tone should of course be a mixture of:

* personal insight of the master
* the love of a follower
* external view of their shortcomings

Parts of the series could be filmed in <<taiwan>> maybe?

Once thing Ciro approves about Li's approach to his family is that he seems to have stated (TODO source) that none of them are Gods like him.

It is however very likely that some of his close family members will take up an even greater importance in the inner circle of power once Li dies: <<what-will-happen-to-falun-gong-when-li-honzhi-dies>>, notably his daughter.

This Falun Gong sources confirm that a "Christina Li" was a Shen Yun lead dancer as of 2011, but does not confirm that she is the daughter of Li Hongzhi: https://www.theepochtimes.com/where-are-the-ancient-arts-of-china-part-4_1491935.html If this is true, talk about <<different-levels-of-truth>>! The article also claims that she has had other pseudonyms, including: "Annie Li" and "Li Jingjing" (李晶晶). Here are web archives of the now broken of course Shen Yun pages Kaiwand links to as evidence of her constant name changing (but no mention of her father):

[[qigong-fever]]
=== Qigong fever (气功热 , 1980's)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong_fever

AKA Qigong Boom.

* https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26268612 特异功能、法功灭火、铝锅传功……80年代的气功热究竟有多疯狂？ (How crazy was the Qi Gong boom after all?) on <<zhihu>>

[[zhong-gong]]
==== Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Gong
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华养生益智功

A very similar religion to <<falun-gong>>, that also emerged during the <<qigong-fever>> of the '80s and '90s.

Zhong Gong was the second most sucessful Qigong Boom religion after Falun Gong.

The similarity of their imagery as seen from propaganda videos is striking. To <<ciro-santilli>>, this makes Zhong Gong a perfect example of why <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong,FLG metaphysics is bullshit>>: it is obvious that both Zhong Gong and Falun Gong and many others were just random dudes who took advantage of the Qigong fever to create their religions.

Their prophet is <<zhang-hongbao>>.

Interestingly, like <<li-hongzhi>> who is from <<jilin>>, Hongbao is also from the Northeast of China (<<heilongjiang>>), there must be a reason why those Qi Gong movements come from that region.

Unlike Falun Gong however, Zhong Gong failed to branch the franchise out of China, and basically died out. Hongbao also died in a car crash in 2006 which didn't help. Li Hongzhi however played smarter, and started branching abroad full force in 1996, he likely predicted that the crackdown was inevitale.

Wikipedia says it reached 34 million followers in China.

Hongbao also has a more spicy history it seems, with sexual allegations and open political goals <<flg-political,unlike Li Hongzhi, who hid his goals better>>. Well played, Li, well played.

<<li-hongzhi>> maintains in <<flg-canon,canon>> that Falun Gong is of course extremely different from all of those other extremely similar Qi Gong religions. Zhong Gong is likely not mentioned by name, but it is also likely one of the main targets. E.g. in 1998 <<flg-canon,canon>> https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980329L.html[]:

____
Dafa can't be obtained lightly. For example, the diversity of cults and the number of false qigongs are large these days, and they lead people astray. Many people who are capable of cultivating get sucked into them, and some of them engage in suicide - it's a mess.
____

this is a perfect example of <<uncanny-valley>>.

Zhong Gong videos:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX72zfEP_zs googd Zhong Gong playlist
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYH8Y_1UmrY&t=1445 Zhong Gong people "experience sharing". It truly is exactly like Falun Gong.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2GxSJK9c-A this appears to be positive mainstream media coverage of Zhong Gong
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ziluy_AlEI video of Hongbao giving a lecture dated 1994 and commented "Qiling kylin Tianhua culture"
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQKCtPSfdR4 video dated January 21st, 2007 of Monks praying after his death
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvJSzeY7Chw contains a bunch of what appear to be extremely low quality Zhong Gong propaganda videos. It is very similar to Falun Gong's of course.

The embassy spokesman says Chinese officials have ample evidence of sect leader Zhang Hongbao's involvement in crimes such as rape and murder.

[[xiang-gong]]
==== Xiang Gong (香功, 中国芳香智悟气功, Qigong religion)

This was possibly the third most popular Qi Gong of the <<qigong-fever>> after <<falun-gong>> and <<zhong-gong>>. It is mentioned for example at <<the-falungong-phenomenon-by-hu-ping-2003>>.

Literal translation:

* Fragrant Gong
* China Fragrang Wisdom Comprehension Gong

It is however so obscure that there isn't even a wikipedia page for it anymore!

The prophet's name was Tian Ruisheng (田瑞生). He's the old due at: https://www.sohu.com/a/270132785_100279655 with little badges on his coat. He can be seen lecturing for example at: https://youtu.be/ItAUwGWSXuI?t=167

Some mentions in English:

* https://taijiclub.live/2020/05/09/xiang-gong-the-fragrant-mind-awakening-qigong/ Xiang Gong: The Fragrant Mind Awakening Qigong (2020) Interesting quote:
+
____
 Basically, the origin of this qigong comes from Master Tian Ruisheng. Master Tian Ruisheng was taught this as a ill young boy by a traveling buddhist monk. He was told to practice it every day and not reveal it until 50 years later. He diligently practiced and eventually taught it after 50 years. It quickly became a popular qigong in China.
____
+
This is exactly the type of "Creation Story" that <<li-hongzhi>> invented. Notably, it is not something he just made up to take advantage of the obvious <<qigong-fever>>. No, it is something that he developped his entire life, and only started teaching at that point due to a coincidence!
+
This is notably highlighted in <<diaries-of-being-in-thailand-with-li-hongzhi-s-family>>. Li's sister just casualy never mentioned to her husband that her brother had been having mystical training for several years, until he finally announced it in the early days of <<falun-gong>>.
+
In Tian's case however, he is truly really old. This is possibly a major reason why he didn't get as big as Falun Gong. It is terribly discriminatory, but who wants to look at an old ugly dude? Especially when he's likely teaching stuff that is supposed to cure diseases. <<li-hongzhi>> and 
* https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2000/05/chinese-crackdown-goes-beyond-falun-gong.aspx Chinese Crackdown Goes Beyond Falun Gong (2000) mentions <<zhong-gong>> and <<xiang-gong>>. Says it is from AP News, but I can't find the original. But the language does look "AP-like".
+
____
China's entirely state-run media and the government have trumpeted the crackdown on Falun Gong. Thousands of practitioners have been detained since it was outlawed in July in the campaign against what the government says is an evil cult.

But authorities refuse to talk about the clampdown on other qi gong organizations, and state media have all but ignored it. So far the campaign has affected at least five groups, practitioners, government sources and human rights organizations say.
____
+
The other groups, even smaller, are mentioned in the article next:
+
** Cibei Gong (慈悲功, Compassion Gong). Possible Chinese name mentioned at: http://www.chinanews.com/2001-02-22/26/72398.html 武汉侦破“法轮功”的变种慈悲功 (Wuhan investigates Falun Gong variant Cibei Gong) from a <<pro-chinese-government-media>>. The word for variant is the same as for "mutation", which brings funnily <<covid>> to mind.
** Guo Gong (国功, Country Gong). Not even the patriotic name was able to prevent crackdown!
** Bodhi Gong. TODO fins Chinese.
+

This is the YouTube channel of a Brazillian Xianggong parcticionner.
+
This reminded <<ciro-santilli>> of a Qigong/Taichi course he went to for a few months when he was a young teenager in Santos, Brazil, attended almost exclusively by older ladies.
+
Some people, even outside China, like "mystic stuff", and may start a mystic stuff practice, more or less affiliated to a certain current of mysticism.
+
Especially since people know nothing about any of the currents, partly due to the language barrier, it often becomes a larger more dilluted current os mysticisms.
+
The same likely applied to that course Ciro attended, but at the time he was clueless and didn't really classify his teacher's influences.
+
Ciro must say however, that some of the exercises were good, and have become a permanent part of Ciro's https://cirosantilli.com/cirodance[Cirodance].
+
The only thing Ciro rejects completely is the metaphysical bullshit: <<does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong>>.
+
Though if something has a lot of metaphysical bullshit, it makes it hard for Ciro to practice it without thinking about the metaphysics.
+
Maria speaks perfect Portuguese, and given the name Lee she must be a second or later generation immigrant. She's likely from Sao Paulo. Here's a video of her in the 70's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaPlwdb5iIw when she was likely in her late 30's, already as a Qigong teacher.
+
Mystical movements like that likely had a decent following in Brazil, especially in the 70's linked to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie[Hippies] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/嬉皮士[嬉皮士]). Ciro's mother mentioned some related stories of her friends.

Most would find they had little in common with non-practitioners ("ordinary people" in Falun Gong parlance) but would maintain cordial relations with friends and family nonetheless, and think of various ways to explain the edge off some of Falun Gong's less palatable teachings about aliens, how heaven views gay people, the inferiority of other religions and Master Li's role in saving the universe.

____
In January 2018, the Church was close to negotiating a deal with China that allows China to have more control over the underground churches and allows the Vatican to have more control over the appointment of bishops. While this did not amount to the establishment of formal diplomatic ties, this was seen as a huge step towards formal recognition.[21] However, Joseph Zen Ze-kiun regarded the warming of diplomatic relationships as selling out the Catholic Church in China, as the process involves the resignation of several bishops of the underground church.

Yes, gay people are also <<evil-west,discriminated to different degrees in Western countries>>, and even legally prohibited notably in the Islamic world.

But <<intolerance,like all minorities>>, they are generally more fucked in <<dictatorship,dictatorships>>, since they can be easily crushed by majorities.

Therefore, all gay people must be against the CCP.

=== Everyone can feel that a profound change is underway by Li Guangman (2021, 李光满《每个人都能感受到，一场深刻的变革正在进行！》)

Politicla essay reposted by major <<chinese-government-media>>:

* <<xinhua>>: http://xinhuanet.com/politics/2021-08/29/c_1127807097.htm
* <<peoples-daily>>: http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2021/0829/c1001-32211523.html

The hole thing is about exerting greater state control on everything, a trend that has been observed as of August 2021, notably on the media.

The damning <<gay-rights>> sentence appears to be:

____
彻底杜绝社会性格中的娘炮和小鲜肉现象，真正让娱乐圈、文艺圈、影视圈风正、气正
____

which translates as:

____
Completely put an end to the phenomenon of sissies and teen idols in the social character, and truly make the entertainment, art, and film and television circles upright and upright.
____

the slang keywords being:

- 娘炮: sissy
- 小鲜肉: teen idols (lit. little fresh meat)

The author Li Guangman (李光满) was not notable enough yet to have a Wikipedia page, not even <<baidu-baike>>, so <<zhihu>> for now: https://www.zhihu.com/question/60685910

It should be noted that the homophobia is just a tiny fraction of the essay, which is much more generally about the state taking more control over everything, including culture, and sparking fears of a second <<cultural-revolution>>.

[[nine-nine-six-icu]]
=== 996.ICU (2019)

https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU

Repository published in 2019-04 protesting against excessive work hours by Chinese programmers.

At some point it moved its README to English.

This was not directly censored to our knowledge, but the fact that it was published on GitHub rather than Chinese social media highlights the obvious fact that Chinese programmers were weary of doing it under CCP controlled media which they do not trust.

The project name refers to:

* "996": work from 9AM to 9PM 6 days a week. This is part of a wider tendency of Chinese netizens to use <<internet-number-slang>>
* "ICU": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit[Intensive Care Unit]

Reached 180k stars in a week, and was the second most starred repository as of 2019-10 https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E100&s=stars&type=Repositories[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20191023084929/https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E100&s=stars&type=Repositories[archive])!!!

Went to Harvard from 2010 to 2014 under pseudonym, apparently Xiao Muzi (小木子).

The news was apparently broken in 2012 by the UK tabloid Daily Mail: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234651/Xi-Jinping-Chinas-new-Princess--daughter-Communist-president-studying-quietly-Harvard.html

____
The Chinese elite is no doubt keen to avoid questions about how exactly Xi Jinping can afford his daughters fees. Officially, his salary is less than $13,000 a year, and Xi's circle has been remarkably cagey about reports of his family's true wealth before.
____

plus 24-hour bodyguards. <<panama-papers>> comes to mind.

Funny names:

* 習包子: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29230 says:
+
____
Xi Jinping got his nickname as "Xi baozi 習包子" ("<<buns,steamed stuffed bun Xi>>") due to the much publicized visit he made to the famous Qìngfēng bāozi pù 庆丰包子铺 ("Qingfeng baozi shop") in Beijing. During and after his visit to the shop, media swarmed over the place and were eager to portray an image of Xi as being down to earth and close to the people. Those who dislike Xi use this nickname sarcastically against him for being a hick and for hypocritically "putting on a show" (zuòxiù 作秀).

* 大撒币: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29230 says:
+
____
It can be translated as "big spender," a play on the literal translation of the words sā bì 撒币 "throw money" and "stupid cunt" (shǎ bī 傻逼). The nickname takes aim at the economic aid Xi has promised to foreign countries; the moniker is so widely used on Chinese social media that the censors' repressive measures only draw more attention to it, and to the criticism embedded within it.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuexi_Qiangguo
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/学习强国
* https://www.xuexi.cn/

App made by <<alibaba>> for the <<ccp>> to teach people <<xi-jinping-thought>>.

Literally means "study for a strong country".

One of the beautiful things about that name is that is reminds one of the <<slang,expression>> "强国人" (strong country person), coined in during the 2014 during the <<hong-kong-protests-2014>> to refer ironically to Mainland Chines people, due to their exaggerated self-perceived strength and superiority, see also <<wumao-2011-vs-little-pink-2021,Wumao 2011 vs little pink 2021>>. A homonym "墙国" (wall country) is also known as a reference to the <<gfw>>, https://archive.ph/czYEv[sample usage].

The app appears to have both content, and also tests to check that you've read the bullshit.

At https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/mnulkd/china_is_forcing_chinese_to_use_national/gu05o20/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 a <<reddit>> user explains:

____
Many people are also forced to use the app "强国学习" in order to keep their jobs. Especially government workers. They have to study XiJinPing thought for certain amount of time each week and do exams.
____

This is confirmed e.g. at: https://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/studies/voices-middle-east-asia/voices-from-east-asia/xuexi-qiangguo-%E2%80%93-digitalization-of-chinese-propaga.html

____

Within the first four months of Xuexi Qiangguo’s release, it was the most downloaded app in China with over 100 million downloads, surpassing China’s most popular messaging, social media and mobile payment app, <<wechat>> and the <<tiktok,Chinese version of TikTok, known as Douyin>>.

To use the app is not exactly voluntary. The Communist Party has issued directives that requires party members to download the app and use it. Many workplaces have done the same and it has been reported that employees are required to send screenshots to document their progress on the app. If they don’t, they are at risk of a pay deduction.

To put it in perspective, over 90 million Chinese are members of the Communist Party, and there are nearly 850 million internet users and almost 690 million smart phone users in China, as of 2019. It is, however, not clear whether the people who have downloaded the app genuinely are interested in learning about Xi Jinping’s political ideology, or if they feel like they must download it to show loyalty to the party.

And there there's an anti-repo for <<wumao>> who oppose the cheating: https://github.com/boycott-fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Boycott-Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo It had 150 stars as of 2021, as oppoesd to 7500 of the cheating repo.

https://github.com/TechXueXi/TechXueXi appears to be a "non-cheating" assistant? TODO confirm. It is at the very least more politically correct.

The repository was created by Tang Wenzheng (唐文正, <<github>> alias https://github.com/Xmader[Xmader]). https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/663593.html According to https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/663593.html form <<china-digital-times>>, he accidentally posted with his real name on an issue once (<<ciro-santilli>> knows that it is basically impossible not to when juggling multiple accounts simultaneously), and subsequently publicly announced his true identity. Following the name reveal, he did an AMA on <<terminus2049>> https://2047.name/t/11552[], and luckily he is abroad, and does not intend to come back. Wenzheng also created the https://github.com/china-digital-times/china-digital-times.github.io <<github>> pages mirror of <<china-digital-times>>, further discussed in that section. At https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo/issues/578 on 2021-03-03, he announced that he would stop working on the project because his parents weren't needing the APP anymore, succession wasn't announced. A few commits followed in the next days, but presumably minimal maintenance and ramp-down.

Wenzheng was also involved in a notable possible copyright dispute with https://musescore.org/en[], a software that Ciro actually enjoyed, as shown at https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882472815 which was then highlighted at https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/onro8q/head_of_strategy_of_muse_group_muse_score/[]. At https://web.archive.org/web/20210719115639if_/https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882450335 the developer noted that this could lead to Xmader's deportation. Some interpreted this as threat, but Ciro feels that it might be true as the developers noted that they withheld action for a while to prevent his deportation.

[[chinese-dream]]
===== Chinese dream (中国梦, 4000 BC -)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Dream
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中國夢

Chinese version of the <<american-dream>>, which <<xi-jinping>> insists is completely different and superior to the <<american-dream>>.

The names suggest, they are not real, but just dreams.

Transcript for <<little-pink-american-dream-vs-chinese-dream,Little pink explains the difference between the American dream  and the Chinese dream>>:

____
美国梦是个人发财的梦 +
讲究冒险 +
通过个人奋斗达到所谓的成功 +
成为有产者 +
然后去剥削别人 +

中国梦是共同富裕 +
追求的是人民幸福 +

换句话说 +
美国梦是个人梦 +
是为美元的梦 +

中国梦是人民梦 +
是为人民服务的梦 +
这就是二者的本质区别 +

以后不要在我面前提起美国梦 +
俗气！ +
____

____
The American dream is a dream of personal wealth +
it focuses on risk taking +
to achieve so-called success through personal struggle +
and become a property owner +
and then exploit others +

The Chinese dream is common prosperity +
to pursue the happiness of the people +

In other words +
the American dream is an individualistic dream +
it is a dream of the Dollar +

The Chinese dream is the people's dream +
Is a dream of serving the people +
This is the essential difference between the two +

Don't bring up the American dream in front of me in the future +
Cheesy! +

[[mao-swim]]
===== Mao swim across the Yangtze river (毛主席畅游长江, 1966-07-16)

https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/毛主席畅游长江

Good <<scmp>> article: https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/1999098/chairman-maos-historic-swim-glorified-china

Mao claimed to have set a swimming record by swimming 15km in 65 minutes at the age of 72 at the <<yangtze-river>> in Wuhan, or an average of 13.8 km/h.

As a comparison, the Olympic swimmers of 2016 covered the lesser distance of 10 km in 113 minutes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_–_Men%27s_marathon_10_kilometre for an average of 5.3 km/h.

According to https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311977913_Analysis_of_the_characteristics_of_offshore_currents_in_the_Changjiang_Yangtze_River_estuarine_waters_based_on_buoy_observations[this article], the maximum current speed of the Yantze is 128.5 cm/s or 4.62 km/h so even if he were swimming with the current, Mao was faster.

In <<the-private-life-of-chairman-mao>> however, the doctor says that this was actually true, the current was enough to drag Mao's big belly quite fast.

Dictatorships would <<censorship-makes-no-one-trust-your-country,never lie about obviously verifiable facts>>, would they?

And idiots today still celebrate this event that preceded the <<cultural-revolution>> which put China's economy in shambles.

<<superputin>> learnt from this and also showed off his swimming skills in 2009.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU-RuR-qO4Y Democracy by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen[Leonard Cohen] (1992). In this interesting song, the Canadian singer suggests that after events such as the fall of the Soviet Union and <<tiananmen>>, greater freedom and democracy would actually first come to the USA, and not to those other countries, the refrain says: "Democracy is coming to the USA" and at one point "It's coming to America first". This is probably because when there is such an adversarial situation such as the cold war, it tends to also make democracies more like dictatorships, as they become readier and readier for war, and thus weakening civil rights, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism[McCarthyism]. Related: <<evil-west>>. The song also criticizes several failures of American democracy, such as social injustice and inequality, suggesting that the newer more peaceful world would help solve them. This is a refreshing take on democracy that has gives it a <<democracy-is-a-religion,less religious view>>.

[[liubukou-massacre]]
=== Liubukou massacre (六部口惨案)

The source website of the photo below is by French journalist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Gauthier[Ursula Gauthier], who explains how those photos were taken by one of the students of the group, who later asked her to take the photos abroad to publish them.

The students were some of the last to leave after the crackdown, and they were trying to escape through a small street that leads into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27an_Avenue[Chang'an Avenue] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/长安街[长安街]) when the tanks came at high speed near Liubukou crossroads half mile West of Tiananmen square, and not all students were able evade the tanks.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jun/01/china.johngittings2 mentions that some bodies had to be scrapped-off the street.

Ursula was later kicked out of China in 2015 after commenting that the CCP had ulterior motives for giving their condolences to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks[November 2015 Paris attacks]. Interesting fact: Ciro was actually less than 1km away from one of the Paris attacks on that night, at his home, and first learnt about what had happened when people started calling to see if he was fine.

The name of the driver of the tank that overran students was reportedly discovered in 2014 as https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/吳彥輝[Wu Yanhui (吴彦辉)], who was aided by <<operation-yellowbird>>. This was based on an witness who had shouted "Remember Tank 106". The study was done by Chinese scholar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Renhua[Wu Renhua] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/吴仁华[吴仁华]).

One of the injured survivors was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang_Zheng[Fang Zheng] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/方政[方政]). At https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHlXF9nTYJ4 方政：在六部口，坦克追杀袭击和平撤离的学生 he claims on an interview with <<voa>> that the students were peacefully evacuating.

https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/l2wqbg/ascii_art_of_tank_man_%E5%9D%A6%E5%85%8B%E4%BA%BA_from_tiananmen_square/gkdbe5d suggested a simpler one that has been in use with Chinese characters:

[[tank-man-emoticon]]
....
占占点人

where:

* the first three characters look like tanks (unrelated meaning)
* the fourth character looks like, and actually means person

So once a gain, <<chinese-characters-are-insane>>.

Some wumaos like to claim that the people taking him away indicates that the people didn't agree with that madman. This interpretation os of course ridiculous.

===== Xiao Bin (Tiananmen witness, 肖斌, 六四证人)

A man named Xiao Bin (肖斌) told ABC News that he saw tunks crushing people, and got a 10 year sentence. <<lu-xun-petition,Lu Xun's petition quote>> comes to mind.

Highlighted at <<the-gate-of-heavenly-peace-1995>> at around 2:53:52.

* http://tsquare.tv/film/transcript_end.php[]

First the reporter asks in the background, untrunscripted, with her English accent (a lot like Ciro's):

____
你有什么反应对这个事情？ +
What's your reaction to the situation
____

The Chinese transcript starts at:

____
政府没有这样用坦克车、用装甲车，对这么多学生进行履带压 +
Is this what the People's Government does? Using tanks to crush people?
____

but the Chinese it is missing the crucial start of the sentence! From this part alone it seems like he is starting to say the the Government did not use tanks to crush people. From hearing the words before are:

____
他怎么去?代表?人的政府，
____

So a more literal translation would be:

____
How can this Government claim to represent the people? A government doesn't use tanks like this, doesn't use armored vehicles like this, to advance towards so many students and crush them under the vehicle's tracks?
____

presumably referring to events such as <<liubukou-massacre>>.

At https://www.npr.org/2009/05/31/104731094/tiananmen-shouts-that-turned-to-silence "I sent a man to labor camp 20 years ago this week." (2009) reporter Alisa Barba who interviewed Xiao Bin reflects on the effect onhis lef

____
And finally, what happened to Xiao Bin? Five years after he was sent to labor camp, a small item appeared in the Chinese news - Xiao had been paroled. He was sent home to Dalian and tracked down there by ABC staffers still working in China. Xiao was in poor health, they discovered, and he wanted help to go to America. That was the last we heard.
____

[[liu-xiaobo]]
==== Liu Xiaobo (刘晓波, 1955-2017)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/刘晓波

He was abroad in the 80' as a scholar, and then he came back to china in 1989 to support <<tiananmen>>, then he was in and out of jail until he died in 2017.

His 2020-06 <<baidu-baike>> https://baike.baidu.com/item/刘晓波/14900221 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200627130112/https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E6%99%93%E6%B3%A2/14900221[]) casually forgot to mention that he might have won the fucking 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, but he seems to be too big to delete the entire page?

It is interesting how <<hao-haidong>> was fully deleted, the page was only locked. It also does not mention all the times he was in jail, notably after Tiananmen, only some of them.

2017-11 Baidu did mention the Nobel prize however: https://web.archive.org/web/20171114165644/https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E6%99%93%E6%B3%A2/14900221 it was edited out later.

The article also makes it very clear that his 2009 sentence was "a fair one", and that the organization he worked for in the 90', https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_for_a_Democratic_China[Federation for a Democratic China] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/民主中国阵线[民主中国阵线]) was funded by the CIA. Wikipedia does not mention that however, but of course, Baidu content does not need citations.

.<<liu-xiaobo>> at <<tiananmen>> on 1989-06-02. He is the second from left, with the speaker. The background seems to be <<monument-to-the-peoples-heroes>>, and this seems to be a still from a video, TODO identify. That monument cellebrate the <<chinese-communist-revolution>>, and ironically contains images of students from <<may-fourth-movement>> protesting at Tiananmen. Liu was one of the people who was begging the students to leave the square once he felt that the government would violently crack down, in order to save lives. For this is considered one of the four <<junzi>> of Tiananmen (天安門四君). Other people in the photo from left to right: Zhou Duo (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/周舵[周舵]). Ji Gaoxin (及高新). Some/all of the junzi felt that peaceful cooperation with the government was the only way forward. This is opposed to the views of others such as <<chai-ling>>, who felt that the sight of blood was necessary to wake up the Chinese masses. Another photo of the four: https://hk.news.yahoo.com/天安門四君子之-周舵認為放下敵我才能推動民主-232800167.html[]. The term is also a reference to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Gentlemen[Four Gentlemen] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/花中四君子[花中四君子]), four plants commonly depicted in Chinese traditional painting of plants. At <<the-gate-of-heavenly-peace-1995>> 1:46:14, Liu Xiaobo mentions how some students had the delusion that they would actually be able to stand up to the army. http://www.open.com.hk/old_version/1011p39.html[Source]

[[hao-haidong]]
===== Hao Haidong (郝海东, 2020)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hao_Haidong
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/郝海东

Hao is widely considered one of the best Chinese soccer players of all time, and he was the top scorer for the Chinese national team of all time as of 2020, and one of the only two Chinese to show on https://iffhs.de/showLegends/men[IFFHS Legends] page which as of 2020 contains only 52 players including the likes of Pelé and Maradona.

He participated in the 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup[FIFA World Cup] (世界杯) qualifiers, and therefore also at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup[2002 FIFA World Cup proper] held in South Korea and Japan, which is the only World Cup China classified for as of 2020, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup[in which it failed to score a single goal].

On 2020-06-03, one day before <<tiananmen>> anniversary, Hao appeared with his wife https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Zhaoying[Ye Zhaoying] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/叶钊颖[叶钊颖], married 2019), who was also a badmington star, on <<guo-wengui>>'s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4aN5h0RqD8&t=4496[], and spoke up against the CCP:

* https://www.scmp.com/sport/china/article/3087684/chinese-sports-couple-hao-haidong-and-ye-zhaoying-face-being-wiped
* https://www.washingtonpost.com/9ae91df2-a6ec-11ea-898e-b21b9a83f792_story.html

As a result, his son https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runze_Hao[Hao Runze] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/郝潤澤[郝润泽], from a previous marriage) who is also a soccer player and had nothing to do with it was also sacked from the Serbian club https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Radnički_Niš[Radnicki Nis] in which he played one week later due to pressure from China: https://www.scmp.com/sport/football/article/3088385/hao-haidongs-son-sacked-serbian-club-radnicki-nis-after-pressure The wiki page says that https://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2020&mm=06&dd=09&nav_id=1693254 says the team says it was just a coincidence and that his contract had ended.

The most interesting thing about all of this, is how Hao's name was completely <<internal-censorship,nuked form the Chinese Internet>>, making this a fantastic opportunity to unambiguously document a censorship event. One is reminded of:

* <<censorship-of-images-in-the-soviet-union>>
* <<nineteen-eighty-four>> "Every record has been destroyed or falsified" quote

The keyword is clear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm[iconoclasm] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/破坏偶像主义[破坏偶像主义])

The article used to mention Hao extensively. He was:

* second on the 知名人物 (famous people)
* was the 进球最多者 (top scorer), a category which as completely removed
* the list 射手榜 (top scorers?) is still there but casually starts at 宿茂臻 with 27 goals, and skips Hao which has 41

In 1995 and 1997 it seems that one the female singles (女子单打), even though they did happen in 1993 and 1999. How curious!

The fact that badminton is a single player sport is great in this case, as it just puts more emphasis on her name as opposed to Hao's multiplayer soccer game:

.In 2020, due to her criticizing the Chinese government together with her husband <<hao-haidong>>, all mention of badminton player Ye Zhaoying (叶钊颖) removed from <<baidu-baike>>. In this particularly funny case, her wins from the 1995 and 1997 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWF_World_Championships[Badminton World Federation World Championships] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/世界羽毛球锦标赛[世界羽毛球锦标赛]) women's singles were simply removed, as if that year the event hadn't happend. In the neighbouring years 1993 and 1999, and every other year, they did of course happen. An https://web.archive.org/web/20171126131320/https://baike.baidu.com/item/世界羽毛球锦标赛[earlier web archive] shows of course that she was the winner in those years.

[[chloe-zhao]]
==== Chloe Zhao (Zhao Ting, 赵婷, 2021 Oscar winner, 获第93奥斯卡最佳电影和导演奖)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloé_Zhao
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/趙婷

Born and raised in China, sent to study in the UK by her wealthy father Zhao Yuji 赵玉吉 at age 15 and later moved to US, but retained Chinese citizenship as far as is publicly known.

In 2013 she told the magazine Filmmaker https://web.archive.org/web/20130814185314/https://filmmakermagazine.com/people/chloe-zhao/[] (later removed from the website):

____
It goes back to when I was a teenager in China, being in a place where there are lies everywhere. You felt like you were never going to be able to get out. A lot of info I received when I was younger was not true, and I became very rebellious toward my family and my background. I went to England suddenly and relearned my history. Studying political science in a liberal arts college was a way for me to figure out what is real. Arm yourself with information, and then challenge that too.
____

TODO was that the only comment she ever made or is there more?

Won the 2021 Oscar (93rd) for best picture and best director on 2021-04-25 for her film Nomadland 无依之地.

And at the same time she was also working on an idiotic superhero movie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternals_(film) to be launched by Disney in the future, and therefore they would likely want it to be released in China, let's see how that will go.

On 2021-04-26 reports emerged that her win was being censored in China: https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-censors-nomadland-director-chloe-zhaos-oscar-win-11619440550 Unlike <<hao-haidong>> however, the order was much more specific: to censor only the fact that she won the Oscars.

As of 2021-04-27 her <<baidu-baike>> page https://baike.baidu.com/item/赵婷/22214113 was still up: https://web.archive.org/web/20210427075523/https://baike.baidu.com/item/赵婷/22214113  let's see how long it lasts. But the page failed to mention the minor detail that she on the Oscar. The comment section, which we're unable to archive contained two types comments:

* she's an American citizen now, not Chinese, just it wasn't reported. But no one has any proof.
* she won the Oscar

https://web.archive.org/web/20210413095903/https://baike.baidu.com/tashuo/browse/content?id=c9fdac1dcf27bdd1280ac9e1&lemmaId=22214113&fromLemmaModule=pcBottom contains a prediction that she would win the Oscar based on earlier recent wins.

The page for the 93rd Oscar mysteriously does not exit however: https://baike.baidu.com/item/第93届奥斯卡金像奖 unlike that of all others: https://baike.baidu.com/item/第92届奥斯卡金像奖 (https://archive.ph/wip/gGGtn[archive]) We can't find an archive either, but it is overwhelmingly likely that it was  created and later deleted. As of 2021-06-21, https://baike.baidu.com/item/奥斯卡金像奖/739020#5 (https://archive.ph/bZFfe#5[archive]) contains a list of all the prizes given so far, linking to the respective per year pages, and the 93rd appears listed but mysteriously without a link.

On <<zhihu>> the topic 93rd Oscar "第93 届奥斯卡金像奖" https://www.zhihu.com/topic/21594057 was deleted:

* up 2021-04-09 https://archive.ph/dZAHE with 13 questions
* down 2021-04-27 https://archive.ph/wip/LYwOb

The Chloe Zhao topic https://www.zhihu.com/topic/20175085/hot was still up: 2021-04-27 with 8 questions: https://archive.ph/wip/CI3vz but funnily that website is so shit that it still links to some deleted questions e.g.: which used to read https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/368060294 "赵婷获第93届奥斯卡最佳导演奖，有思想的女孩子最可爱" but is down https://archive.ph/wip/6eiTl

so holy fuck, Ciro actually feels this one could honestly be a <<spy,CIA deletion request>>. Unfortunately Ciro never managed to watch it before it was deleted.

offcn is the short name for the company 中公教育党委 which literally means "Chinese Public Education Party". TODO what do they do exactly? They seem to have strong CCP party links: http://edu.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0510/c1006-29977260.html[], maybe they are a "corporate training" company for the CCP itself.

____
Discussing companies that operate in America and refuse to hire black people. These companies avoid following U.S. EEO laws because they're headquartered in mainland China, a country that does not protect people of color from racial discrimination.
____

The video shows a call with a black man (TODO who is that) where he talks about anti-black racism on employment in China. Nothing eye-popping, mostly references <<we-dont-hire-blacks-by-aaron-dewitt-2020>>. Mentions he is under NDA and cannot reveal the name of the company.

[[kaiwind]]
====== Kaiwind (pro-CCP media)

http://kaiwind.com/

Anti-religion, and notably, anti-<<falun-gong>> website in Chinese.

It must be said however that they do contain at least some information that seems to be true/interesting.

Including open secrets that every Falun Gong believer knows about but does discuss much publicly, e.g. details of <<li-hongzhis-family>>, and Sun Senjun's account.

Ciro has no proof that this is linked to the government, but it is very likely, even the Chinese embassy website links to it:

* http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/lj/t36322.htm
* https://web.archive.org/web/20180414233331/http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/lj/t36322.htm

[[falun-gong-media]]
==== Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)

A great example of how <<falun-gong>> is <<flg-organized,highly organized>>.

Likely highly de-facto controlled by <<li-hongzhi>>, and extremely <<flg-transparent,lacking clear full disclosure of their affiliation>>.

For example, Li refers to Falun Gong media as "our media" in <<flg-canon>>, and has given many many talks in gatherings specific to those media. E.g. in the https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20090606L.html[Fa Teaching Given at the NTDTV Meeting (2009)]:

_____
<<making-cult-members-work-long-hours-for-free,You have really been working hard>>. [...]

You have your path, while human beings have their affairs. You have things that you need to do. Don’t give any concern or attention to political things or what happens between parties. Of course, our media don’t really have a choice about reporting on it, since those are probably things that ordinary people are interested in.
_____

It could be argued that those media are not "directly" controlled by Li Hongzhi, and Ciro does believe that they were created independently of him initially.

But without doubt they are controlled by his top followers, and if Li Hongzhi ever gave directions, which Ciro has no proof he has ever done, then those media would follow.

And since Li has given such direct endorsement to it, contributing has become a de-facto religious obligation, and one which constitutes a great part of <<making-cult-members-work-long-hours-for-free>>.

Ciro believes without evidence that Li Hongzhi gives specific directives to the top tenants of those organizations from time to time when important issues arise. Ciro believes that one of such issues is the support of Donald Trump: <<flg-trump>>.

Furthermore, Li appears to directly cite some of the main media in Canon or talk at their conferences as Canon.

One thing must be said in their favour however: they are incorruptible in their fight against the CCP.

[[epoch-times]]

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Epoch_Times
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/大纪元时报

Falun Gong's newspaper with news for "general public consumption" an no clear affiliation indication.

In <<flg-canon,canon>>: https://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jiangfa10_3.htm or https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20091017L.html "Fa Teaching Given at the Epoch Times Meeting" from 2009-10-17:

____
There are so many things you have to do. You have to do your ordinary job and do it well, you have to manage your family's affairs, and as Dafa disciples you need to make time for Fa-study and exercises; you also need to clarify the truth, as well as participate in Dafa projects, such as The Epoch Times.
____

In 2020-11-08 https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/11/8/n12534746.htm the Epoch Times published a poem by Li Hongzhi, just after Trump was announced to lose the presidential elections, see also:  <<flg-trump>>.

Falun Gong's newspaper with news for "general public consumption" an no clear affiliation indication.

____
Things are changing rapidly as the Fa-rectification forges ahead and as Dafa disciples' righteous thoughts grow stronger. The energy emitted by NTDTV is very strong
____

"Fa-rectification", amazing jargon, see also "Cult-speak" from <<orange-papers>>.

[[china-uncensored]]
====== China Uncensored (pro-Falun Gong media)

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFP46yVT-GG4o1TgXn-04Q

Hosted by Chris Chappell.

Syster interview podcast channel: China Unscripted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o1sZefER0E The three makers of China Uncesored appear on the videos.

Older shows had an "ndt.tv" water mark on top right, e.g. a 2013 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMvS3lgJBs

The video description also links to http://e.ntd.tv/NTDChinaUncensored which is now down, but has archives such as https://web.archive.org/web/20130321071835/http://e.ntd.tv/NTDChinaUncensored which suggest a redirect back to the YouTube channel:

____
Redirecting to...

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZZhVHPaO1ziCc9dRPrgbz2KU0aZF7CJ-
____

TODO why did newer videos remove the water mark and clear link? Did they break links, or just to hide Falun Gong influence?

Home page gives extremely unusual importance to Falun Gong resources, e.g.:

* http://www.chinauncensored.tv/about/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20190426203719/http://www.chinauncensored.tv/about/[archive]) "China Uncensored is available to watch on this website, on YouTube, on New Tang Dynasty Television"

[[minghui]]
===== Minghui (明慧网, Falun Gong media)

https://en.minghui.org/

Falun Gong's primary "social network"/"Falun Gong"-only news/propaganda website. More Falun Gong specific than <<epoch-times>>.

Literally: clear (明) wisdom (慧) network (网)

Li speaking to Minghui conference in <<flg-canon,canon>>: https://big5.falundafa.org/chibig5/jiangfa10_1.htm

TODO how https://www.clearwisdom.net/ compares?

[[shen-yun]]
===== Shen Yun Performing Arts (神韵艺术团, Falun Gong media)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Yun_Performing_Arts
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/神韵艺术团

A good testimony from an ordinary employee from 2013: <<aarvoll-shenyun,Aarvoll's account>>.

Openly directly controlled by <<li-hongzhi>>. He features as director on librettos, e.g. the 2013 one (credited "D. F." (Da Fa) and with his photo).

Shen Yun's headquarters are also located in/near <<dragon-springs>>.

Li mentions Shen Yun in <<flg-canon,canon>>: https://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jiangfa11_2.htm

On thing Ciro couldn't help but notice is that the "CCP guards beating up Falun Gong people" scenes felt a lot like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_opera[Revolutinary operas] of the <<mao-zedong>> period in their aesthetics. Maybe this is an intentional reference.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mQ8plzWl9g "They tried to get me to post Chinese propaganda" by J.J. McCullough (2019) talks about Shen Yun and Falun Gong in general, and how he was offered to post anti-Shen Yun propaganda for 500 dollars.

[[bannedbook]]
===== bannedbook.org (禁闻网, pro-Falun Gong media)

The main Chinese name is 禁闻网 which stands for "banned news network", and is more accurate than the domain name "bannedbook" since the majority of material published appears to be recent banned articles.

Classifying this as Falun Gong media because most or possibly all of the sidebar recommended websites 推荐网站 are also Falun Gong media e.g. as of 2020-04: https://web.archive.org/web/20200427221744/https://www.bannedbook.org/[] includes <<epoch-times>> and https://hongzhi.li/[], so yeah, not much doubt.

From this we deduce that the "banned book" in the domain name originally likely referred more specifically to the banned Falun Gong sacred books: <<flg-canon>>.

Once again, <<flg-transparent>> is in need.

TODO who is behind this website? They store full text copies of banned articles, e.g. https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/baitai/20190816/1175647.html is a full text copy of http://yashalong.blog.caixin.com/archives/188877 which is mentioned at: <<nazi>>.

[[tuidang]]
===== Tuidang movement (退党, Falun Gong media)

* https://tuidang.org/
* https://en.tuidang.org/

Falun Gong campaign asking Chinese people to revoke their CCP membership.

Extremely common when <<falun-gong-preaching>> on the streets in touristic areas where Chinese tourists will be present. Fake names will be accepted, so it is obviously just a symbolic act.

A bit less than 10% of the Chinese population are registered CCP members: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party[]. So it is not obligatory, and there likely restrictions. But there must also be some kind of benefits involved. See also: https://daily.jstor.org/communist-party-of-china/

* https://github.com/china-digital-times/data/ the data

Firs commit  Jun 30, 2019. The first article is from 2010, so maybe it did scrape everything. It appears to be automatically updated daily. The images seem to be re-uploaded to https://statically.io/[], e.g. https://china-digital-times.github.io/?/id/664606 contains https://cdn.statically.io/gh/china-digital-times/files/master/2021/04/image-1617989397104.png which just fetches from GitHub automatically: https://github.com/china-digital-times/files/blob/master/2021/04/image-1617989397104.png[] while the original article https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/664606.html stores images locally: https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/files/2021/04/image-1617989397104.png[]. This approach is more censorship resistant, since all images are under a single domain, so takedown would require a full statically domain takedown, which would break other things.

Li's livestreams also featured extravagant displays of wealth, including stacks of cash, luxury watches, and expensive sports cars."
** Lu Benwei (卢本伟, alias 55kai): "As for Lu Benwei, profanity eventually became his undoing. After being accused of using cheats when live-streaming a game in November 2017, Lu vehemently defended himself on his channel, insulting the content creator who made the accusation and instigating fans to verbally abuse him."
** Chen Yifa: "offense stemmed from a single live-streaming session in 2016.

She also described a game character's movement as honoring the Yasukuni"

In Part Three, Chapter 3, O'Brien explains the end goal of their evil government system to Winston:

____
In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy--everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always--do not forget this, Winston--always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.'
____

On Part Two, Chapter 5, Winston explains the <<censorship,erasing of the past>> to Julia:

____
Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories.

[[law-of-gravity-1984]]
==== Law of Gravity passage from Nineteen Eighty-Four (《十九八十四》中的万有引力段落)

On Part Three, Chapter 4, The Law of Gravity quote perfectly illustrates the <<ccp>>'s approach to lying:

____
Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he THINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see him do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.

=== Brave New World books passage (美丽新世界的书籍段落, 1932)

This amazing passage from from Chapter 17 is a good example of <<different-levels-of-truth>>:

____
The Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the bookshelves. The heavy door swung open. Rummaging in the darkness within, "It's a subject," he said, "that has always had a great interest for me." He pulled out a thick black volume. "You've never read this, for example."

The Savage took it. "The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments" he read aloud from the title-page.

"Nor this." It was a small book and had lost its cover.

"The Imitation of Christ"

"Nor this." He handed out another volume.

"The Varieties of Religious Experience. By William James."

"And I've got plenty more," Mustapha Mond continued, resuming his seat. "A whole collection of pornographic old books. God in the safe and Ford on the shelves." He pointed with a laugh to his avowed library to the shelves of books, the rack full of reading-machine bobbins and soundtrack rolls.

"But if you know about God, why don't you tell them?"

==== Water Margin (水浒传)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Margin
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/水浒传
* https://cirosantilli.com/water-margin

We should make a montage with some <<chinese-dissidents>> side by side with Water Margin characters. The analogy is just so strong!

The slogan would be 现代好汉，替天行道：向持不同政见者水浒传的致敬 (Modern day Heroes: Water Margin Homage to the dissidents)

For the image:

* <<wei-jingsheng>> vs Song Jiang: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SongJiang.jpg[]. The rebel leader. Wei Jingsheng is an early strong voice of democracy in China, so fit for a leader. 
* <<liu-xiaobo>> vs Lu Zhishen uprooting a tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lu_Zhishen_Water_Margin_2.jpg[]. Both are somewhat pacifists, Zhishen being a monk, and Xiaobo wanted people to leave the square at Tiananmen to not get killed.
* <<liu-shihui-one-party-rule,Liu Shihui>> vs Lin Chong just after killing Lu Qian:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yoshitoshi-Lin_Chong.jpg[]. Both brave thin dudes standing up.
* <<quan-ping,Quan Ping>> vs Wu Song killing the tiger: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wu_Song_Water_Margin.jpg[]. Just two strong dudes.
* <<hao-haidong>> vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Zhi_(Water_Margin)[Yang Zhi] killing the man at the bridge. Hao Haidong is a good choice because he is actually physically impressive. Unfortunate how the first thing that comes to mind is Gao Qiu, the evil dude!
* <<yue-xin>> vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Erniang[Sun Erniang], the image is a still from the 1998 series episode 20. Two chicks. There are only 3 women in water margin, and she is perhaps the most well known because she made mantous out of human flesh.

Some others that could be used in the future:

* Chen Mei and Cai Wei from <<terminus2049>>. TODO for them it would be good if we could have two closely related characters. Perhaps
  * Ruan brothers: Ruan Xiao'er, Ruan Xiaowu, Ruan Xiaoqi. More notable than the Zhang brothers most likely. The problem is that they are 3.
  * the brothers Zhang Heng and Zhang Shun, the only question is if they are memorable enough. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Senkaji_Chao_wringing_out_hin_loincloth.jpg and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Utagawa_Kuniyoshi_-_水滸傳_-_張順.jpg perhaps.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9046783/Leaked-files-expose-mass-infiltration-UK-firms-Chinese-Communist-Party.html

____
After authenticating the material, with the help of data security analysts Internet 2.0, IPAC passed the database to four media organisations around the world, including The Mail on Sunday.

Security sources believe the initial data leak came from a dissident who targeted an outwardly unremarkable office block in Shanghai which housed the records.

Despite the near certainty of being executed for treason if caught, he or she probably accessed it via a server before downloading it on to a laptop and releasing it on Telegram where it was found by <<ipac,IPAC>>.

The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government.

On the same day, the news that the personal information of 1.95 million party members in Shanghai had been leaked was suddenly widely discussed in major overseas forums. Many comments pointed out that the relevant list appeared to be authentic.

Epoch Times reporters downloaded two Excel files containing information about CCP members of Shanghai governments, institutions, and enterprises according to the relevant links.

This list appeared on the Internet as early as a month ago. On July 21, a person named "Chief Referee" (总裁判) broke the news on Overseas Chinese Network (海外中文网爆料) that "the register of all party members in Shanghai was leaked."

A fundamental quote by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal[Blaise Pascal] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/布莱兹·帕斯卡[布莱兹·帕斯卡]) from his https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettres_provinciales[Lettres provinciales] (1656-1657):

____
The war in which violence endeavours to crush truth is a strange and a long one.

All the efforts of violence cannot weaken truth, but only serve to exalt it the more.

The light of truth can do nothing to arrest violence; nay, it serves to provoke it still more.

When force opposes force, the more powerful destroys the less; when words are opposed to words, those which are true and convincing destroy and scatter those which are vain and false; but violence and truth can do nothing against each other.

Yet, let no one imagine that things are equal between them; for there is this final difference, that the course of violence is limited by the ordinance of God, who directs its workings to the glory of the truth, which it attacks; whereas truth subsists eternally, and triumphs finally over its enemies, because it is eternal, and powerful, like God Himself.

[[internal-censorship]]
==== Internal censorship is necessary to prevent fake USA accounts from creating harmful propaganda (内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华人民共和国言论审查

The USA cannot create enough fake accounts to overwhelm real 1.5 billion Chinese accounts, especially considering things like forcing mobile number account verification.

Chinese politicians are just using this fear as an excuse to stay in power: <<evil-west>>.

What if a Chinese person who really loves China and wants to improve the country disagrees with the Government?

What if this person is right, and wants to express this publicly to get support and make change happen?

Should this person just be put into jail as is done currently? Do you really think that the CCP can never do anything seriously wrong? <<chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens>>?

When citizens stop trying to contribute due to fear, this is known as the <<chilling-effect>>.

What if a <<is-chinese-politician-x-evil,politician>> does something bad, and <<corruption,suppresses the news to protect themselves>>?

Without freedom of speech, who will watch over the actions of those in power? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]

____

With internal censorship, leaders inevitably become <<xi-jinping,Gods>>, and soon zealous sons betray their fathers and brothers in loyalty to the leader and their fake ideal. See for example: <<man-in-the-high-castle>>.

[[man-in-the-high-castle]]

The famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heine[Heinrich Heine] (German but from the 19th century, before the Nazis) saying also comes to mind:

____

他们在哪里烧书籍，他们也会烧人 +
____

Do you not think that this translates well to the modern version:

____
Where they have deleted online posts, they will end in deleting human beings.
____

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars[Burning of books and burying of scholars] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/焚书坑儒[焚书坑儒], 212 BC) also comes to mind.

It is actually easier for the USA to manipulate a dictatorship than a democracy, because then all you have to do is buy/blackmail a few key corrupt politicians instead of manipulating millions of people's feeds.

.Internal censorship is so strong, that many Chinese people who leave China to live abroad continue to believe that the CCP is always right, despite having access evidence that suggests otherwise. This <<rebel-pepper>> 2019-08 cartoon shows frogs coming out of a big well still remain inside their own small wells made up of Chinese media such as <<zhihu-purge,Zhihu>> and CCTV.

[[china-has-more-freedom-of-speech-than-the-usa]]
==== China has more freedom of speech than the USA! (中国比美国有更多的言论自由！)

When you hear that online, it really makes you wonder if those people believe it or are <<wumao,paid to say it>>.

Luckily, this is easy to verify: just create an online account on a Chinese website, and start posting about censored political subjects, and wait for your account to get banned.

Then create an account on an American website, and start posting about censored political subjects. The first good question is: what will you post about since no political subject is censored?

Here is one concrete and well documented example: <<zhihu-purge>>.

Or maybe why not <<t-shirt,go out on the street in China with a T-shirt with censored words and share some photos online>>?

Another option is to point them to the political report categories of the <<cac-report-website>>.

[[dictator-needs-gfw]]
===== Would ending the Great Firewall truly end the dictatorship? (结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)

Not 100% sure.

In <<russia>>, for example, the Internet is relatively free, but the government controls most professional media, which is what most people end up seeing, by suing dissidents media out of business.

But on the other hand Russia is already much freer than China.

Although I don't like them, I can't deny one thing: the commies are smart, and when they do something (e.g. censorship), it tends to keep them in power.

[[gfw-to-protect-from-usa]]
===== The Great Firewall is necessary to protect China from harmful USA propaganda and data collection (防火墙对于保护中国免受美国有害的宣传和数据收集是必要的)

<<ciro-santilli>> doesn't think this is below the USA, but:

* without censorship, you would be much richer and stronger, and more able to defend yourselves
* why does China also censor its own people in addition to foreign propaganda?
* maybe this fear is greatly emphasized by the Chinese government beyond truth just to help them keep control of the country by fear and maintain their own power. Can the Americans really have that much influence in your country? <<evil-west>>
* maybe the regions that want to split from China feel like China is not giving them anything back, and they are themselves looking for allies outside of China to help them split. With democracy, people are more likely to get what they want, and there will be split parties and votes.
* the same argument can be used to justify any action, no matter how bad. E.g.: we must put all who criticize the government in jail, or else they will make China less united and weaker against the USA!

[[wayback-machine]]
====== Wayback Machine (web.archive.org, 网站时光机)

Their Wayback Machine tool archive snapshots of webpages and allows youto browse the history of all archives:

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/网站时光机

By the Internet Archive organization:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/互联网档案馆

This Chrome extension helps to quickly archive pages: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak

But remember that if you archive too many in a very quick succession before the previous ones have been archived, even if manually through that plugin, your account/IP might get blocked, so just give a few seconds for the current archive to terminate before starting new ones.

This happened to Ciro in 2020-06-14, but then he emailed the admins as mentioned at: https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360016379432-Accounts-Tips-Troubleshooting- and they re-enabled it.

As of 2021, it annoys Ciro very much that you have to wait for a few minutes for the archived page to become visible. That's an eternity when you are writting a text and need to link to an archive.

It is also extremelly annoying that they sometimes change image URLs randomly after they've become visible. Why is that? E.g. Ciro saw breaks between different timestamps:

* https://web.archive.org/web/20220125110448im_/http://bitfossil.org/81f6d302a0ed4ffefa674834d0c4a02cdc6639f213713d48946225956fc96d85/WeAreStarStuff.jpg was working but stopped
* https://web.archive.org/web/20220125210751if_/http://bitfossil.org/81f6d302a0ed4ffefa674834d0c4a02cdc6639f213713d48946225956fc96d85/WeAreStarStuff.jpg was working

and aso betweeen `im` vs `if` as in:

* https://web.archive.org/web/20220125112530im_/http://bitfossil.org/86a0e565ba2698d4abc03253b9de47e88d3de4f62ee90722e6e7845a1c8e3aa7/HugPuddle.jpg

so it is just not reliable enough to use generally.

It is possible to request social media pages you own to be removed from the archive in some circumstances: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/143529/is-it-possible-to-request-to-remove-page-snapshots-from-a-personal-social-media

Some website specific techniques:

* YouTube videos: they do seem to download them!
** But as as of 2020, they seem to have some serious bugs failing with "Sorry the Wayback Machine does not have this video (<id>) archived (or not indexed yet)." on most videos: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/149933/why-does-the-archive-org-of-most-youtube-videos-fail-with-sorry-the-wayback-mac
** And the interface may be very broken, possibly due to the arabic youtube interface, you might just have to click around sometimes. So the best thing is to just always use the magic direct video link: of form: https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/<video-id>

[[archive-today]]
====== archive.today (archive.is)

http://archive.is/

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive.today
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive.is

Like <<wayback-machine>> by unknown shady individuals, so less trustworthy.

CrunchBase claims without source New York based: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/145817/on-which-country-are-the-creators-and-servers-of-archive-today-archive-is-base

Does not care about robots.txt, so it sometimes works where Wayback Machine fails, so its better than nothing when it does. E.g. it is a good option for <<quora>>.

And no, you can't Wayback Machine archive an archive.is, they blocked the domain.

Has specific LinkedIn handling as it has a logged scrape account, e.g.: https://archive.vn/EPaEH[]. TODO find account URL.

Also has specific GitHub handling, e.g. as seen at: https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/invest-openapi/issues/278 TODO what for?

Their github account was: https://github.com/volth an archive https://archive.vn/kqftP The account was completely deleted presumaly after GitHub noticed the anti-ToS usage: all their issues created have been deleted, not converted to ghost as happens with account deletion, and non-owners cannot delete their issues, only comments. Since he was such a large NixOS contributor, this was notice by other contributors: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-was-this-treewide-pr-performed/11174/15 | https://twitter.com/grhmc/status/1334138105738256389

From the non-trivial contributions, they were a big NixOS contributor, and are clearly fluent Russian:

* https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/91184 "[staging] perlPackages: update" was merged.
* https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/invest-openapi/issues/278 "Инструменты "для квалифицированных инвесторов" недоступны через API" is a sample issue in fluent Russian

By cloning NixOS NixOS/nixpkgs we obtain an email, it uses custom domain http://volth.com/ as of 2021-02-04 has a copy of the Google 404: https://web.archive.org/web/20190913083033/http://volth.com/ This is the case since 2013. In 2011 it was some other random company.

Google photo matches exactly this "Masha Rabinovich" https://www.linkedin.com/in/masha-rabinovich-52aa3a197/[], or is just some image of a well known person? Account marked as "Bachelor of Engineering" at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

The same photo seems to be used for all fetches: https://archive.vn/IPEEd[].

Googling name leads to an YouTube account whose only video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1bp1VxMwP4 | https://archive.vn/9Xq6w "How to make an archive.is link with selection hashtag", so yes, the relation is almost certain.

https://www.northkoreatech.org/2016/09/21/north-koreas-dns-files-reveal-internet-websites/ has an archive.is related comment by an user of the same name Masha Rabinovich: September 22, 2016 at 17:55 "There are some more websites in .kp: http://archive.is/*.kp"

In 2008 they had some interest in compilers: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2008-11/msg00015.html The obvious gmail email can be obtained from there. The only hit is in this creepy email list: https://api.intelx.io/file/read?type=1&systemid=989faa9e-46a1-440f-87fa-2a98b616c66d&k=7b256c65-6ebf-4bb8-a301-070bce8dec01

Removing the space leads to more matches:

Wikipedia suggests that the name Masha Rabinovich is likely of Russian Ashkenazi Jewish origin:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masha
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabinovich

so if the LinkedIn information is real, maybe they just went to study in Germany, or their ancestors migrated there.

The name in Cyrillic would be "Маша рабинович", but we couldn't find any information of interest by searching for that.

[[google-cache]]
====== Google Cache

https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1687222?hl=en

Google caches every indexed page that shows up on the search, you just have to click on the arrow and select "Cache" to see it.

The advantage over <<wayback-machine>> is that Google crawls many more pages than the Wayback Machine.

How to get the Google cache for a given URL: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15633/how-to-modify-a-url-to-get-a-google-cached-version-of-page

It is not possible however to see old caches, therefore you have to archive the Google caches with <<wayback-machine>> if you find anything interesting in them to not lose it:

* https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/45306/how-do-you-view-all-the-cached-versions-of-a-web-page
* https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/18638126?hl=en

The Google cache also has a text-only mode which is great for more complex webpages like those on <<zhihu>>, which due to JavaScript madness keep showing and disappearing.

====== geoscreenshot

https://www.geoscreenshot.com

Takes screenshots of the websites much like <<wayback-machine>>, but you can select the location.

Once the screenshot is made, you can "view the HTML", and that gives an Amazon AWS link, and warns that JavaScript and CSS might/will be disabled. The screenshot does not state what the origin URL/data is, so it cannot be used as a proof. But we can <<wayback-machine>> archive it to make sure it remains visible. E.g.:

* 2020-09-30 https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship | http://web.archive.org/web/20200930075102/https://s3.amazonaws.com/geoscreenshot-static/d3fdb97d-2ac3-4f57-a737-6fab2997fb1a.html see also <<github-censored-subdomains>>

* 2020-09-30 https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/ | https://archive.vn/bIzkH see alo <<mirrors>>

The free trial is very limited, and you can't share the screenshots on a public URL. See also: <<censorship-monitoring>>.

====== Geo Targetly

https://geotargetly.com/

This one can actually share screenshots for different countries, nice: https://geotargetly.com/geo-browse?url=https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/266&country_code=CN

Small deatail: it doesn't work, or it takes forever, either one.

This amazing standardized feature encrypts the domain as well as the URL.

This means that censors are unable to block only certain websites via DNS blocks, which is one of the main techniques used. But they can still block by IP, no?

In 2020-08, it was reported that the firewall was already blocking it: https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-is-now-blocking-all-encrypted-https-traffic-using-tls-1-3-and-esni/

[[icp-license]]
===== ICP license 非经营性网站备案 (2000)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICP_license
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/非经营性网站备案

Part of the <<internal-censorship,Internet censorship machine>>, although it predates the GFW proper.

It can be seen at the bottom of many many many websites, it is likely mandatory to display it.

If you see one of those, you already know that it cannot be trusted for politics.

For example, https://archive.is/ePBM9[as of April 2020], the <<zhihu>> sidebar shows:

____
京 ICP 备 13052560 号 - 1
____

where "京" indicates that the certificate was issued by the Beijing Provincial level city.

In 2014, almost 15 years later, <<russia>> finally caught up, what a relief: <<russia-mandatory-registration-of-bloggers>>.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH_tiIAk5Q8 Missing typewriter scene from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others[The Lives of Others (2016)] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/竊聽風暴[竊聽風暴]). The Wikipedia page for <<samizdat>> mentions that: "All Soviet-produced typewriters and printing devices were officially registered, with their typographic samples collected right at the factory and stored in the government directory." This reminded Ciro of this movie set in East Germany, in which finding a typewriter plays as big role as evidence of authorship of subversive materials. In the movie, the typewriter was not present under the floor boards as had been informed by the Leading Lady who betrayed her lover, the Leading Man, under duress. The typewriter had been previously secretly removed by a disgruntled intelligence officer who turns against the censorship and surveillance system in the middle of the film. The disgruntled officer is then fired/has his career stalled by his colleagues, who suspect him but have no direct evidence, and the Leading Man, after investigating how the machine could have disappeared, eventually discovers the identify of the officer, but ends up not meeting him, as he would not know what to say. Just another story of the horrors of the surveillance state.

Some fear that only state media and official propaganda accounts will get permission. While permits have been needed since at least 2017 to write about topics such as political and military affairs, enforcement has not been widespread. The new rules expand that requirement to health, economics, education and judicial matters."

===== Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC, 国家互联网信息办公室, 中央网信办)

This is where the <<censorship,Internet censors>> work.

[[cac-report-website]]
====== CAC report website (12321.cn, 12377.cn, 12339, 中央网信办举报网站)

These are official Chinese government websites that can be used to report cybercrime, including fraud and identity theft, but also political <<thoughtcrime,thoughcrime>>:

* http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm
* https://www.12321.cn
* http://12377.cn
* 12339 is more <<spy,spy>>/national security focused

Reports such as https://www.theage.com.au/world/asia/china-exporting-ccp-speech-controls-to-australia-as-second-university-caught-in-row-20200805-p55irf.html highlighted that these websites has a "report harmful or garbage information" entry, which can notably be used by Chinese expats to report people who badmouth the CCP, and in particular other Chinese nationals.

Typing "国家互联网信息办公室" on Google autocompleted to "国家互联网信息办公室举报" (举报 == report), and finds http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm[].

This is clearly an official government website due to the `gov.cn` URL, and it also has an <<icp-license>>.

One of the categories of report on that page is: "网络不良与垃圾信息举报受理中心" (center for reporting harmful or garbage information, https://web.archive.org/web/20200704135840/http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm[archive]).

Notably, there is one separate entry for illegal activity as well (网络违法犯罪举报网站) and another one for <<porn,pornography (中国扫黄打非网)>>, so it is interesting to see that there is one specifically for "misinformation".

The harmful information page redirects to: https://www.12321.cn/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20200907150310/https://www.12321.cn/[archive]) which has further categories.

The "report website" (举报不良网站) category links to https://www.12321.cn/web (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807060758/https://www.12321.cn/web[archive]) and then has a "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary[reactonary] and <<politically-sensitive,politically sensitive>>" (link:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/反动[反动]及<<politically-sensitive,政治敏感>>) checkbox.

After you submit, it leads you to: https://www.12321.cn/suc (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807063330/https://www.12321.cn/suc[archive]) in which you can optionally provide further contact details: https://www.12321.cn/reg[]. This appears to be no link with the previous page, so they might just do it via IP. Registration requires both a cell phone and an email.

From the website source code (very simple, hand written, we see that it uses <<baidu,Baidu Analytics>>. The CCP obviously trusts Baidu a lot :-)

On 2020-09-07, <<mirrors,cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship>>'s Google Analytics had a hit coming from http://jbcz.12377.cn/report/center/web.index[] ("This site can't be reached" on Chrome). This was soon after <<ciro-santilli>> mentioned <<cac-report-website>> at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/149#issuecomment-688084645[]. This is presumably the censor's web UI to review reports. "jb" from jbcz presumably means Ju Bao (举报), the CZ Ciro couldn't guess. Other hits:

* 2020-10-14 http://jbcz.12377.cn/report/load/operate.index[]
* 2021-05-18 https://jbcz.12377.cn to https://cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship[] <<mirrors>>. On same day also a hit from http://123.125.45.236:9007[], that appears to be an IP in China.
** 2021-06-08 had another hit from 123.125.45.236:9007 to https://cirosantilli.com/cirosantilli[], a page that does not exist. Must be some weird routing of theirs. This after some bytedance.feishu.cn hist.

The toplevel http://12377.cn (https://web.archive.org/web/20200907235842/https://www.12377.cn/[archive]) is entitled "中央网信办（国家互联网信息办公室）违法和不良信息举报中心" and is another report website. It is also linked to from http://www.cac.gov.cn/hdzx/jbzx/A091102index_1.htm under different categories, so it is also official.

The first category in that page is "政治类" (political category). From there we have some awesome information.

First it links to the report guidelines (举报指南) https://www.12377.cn/jbzn.html?tab=4 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200902094911/https://www.12377.cn/jbzn.html?tab=4[archive])

so yes, attacking the party and major policies is illegal in China, big news, right? "Involved in attacking the party and state system and major policies" is then one of the categories in the report page.

Soon after the previous events in 2020-09-08, anaytics got a hit from http://openurls.com.cn/ to https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship[]. The only function of that website appears to be to open a newline separated list of websites into separate tabs. Maybe a censor bulk quickly having a look at several tasks. It is basically a clone of https://www.openallurls.com/[] but with an <<icp-license>> :-) The 2020-10-14 hit from http://jbcz.12377.cn was followed by another hit from http://openurls.com.cn/[], further reinforcing that this is part of their review procedure. 3 more hits on `/` and `/ciro-santilli` on 2020-02-22 after pinging a few people on https://github.com/zaohmeing/21- issues. Another hit 2021-03-19 to https://cirosantilli.com[], unknown cause

Further hits from https://openurls.com.cn[]:

[[it-is-not-possible-to-block-a-single-page-of-an-https-website]]
===== It is not possible to block a single page of an HTTPS website (无法阻止 HTTPS 网站的单个页面)

It is not possible for the <<ccp>> to block only certain pages of websites that use HTTPS.

This is because the connection is encrypted: the CCP can only see which domain the user is accessing, but only the website itself can see which page was requested.

So either they have to block the entire IP/domain name, or nothing.

This is the basis of <<keyword-attack>>.

One way that the CCP works around this is <<chinese-web-browser-censorship>>.

Known events:

* 2020-08: https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/notepad-plus-plus-blocked-in-china/ "Text editor Notepad{plus}{plus} banned in China after ‘Stand With Hong Kong' update" where "banned" means "the download page where they keywords are shown is now blocked in Chinese browsers". The rest of the website is still up. So no domain block due to HTTPS, browser only action for now.

[[chinese-web-browser-censorship]]

[[wumao]]
==== Wumao (五毛)

50 Cent Party, 五毛党, Wumao Dang:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/网络评论员

They can be classified as a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare[information warfare] (link:https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/信息战[信息战]).

A wise person once said:

____
It is impossible to distinguish wumaos, <<little-pink,idiots>> and <<not-chinese,brain washed>> people. So we just call all of them wumaos.
____

But of course, the <<ccp-cult,CCP is a cult>> (and <<democracy-is-a-religion,democracy, a religion>>), and therefore <<preconceived,any discussion is also pointless>> in general.

To a large extent, wumao's goals are to dilute useful conversation with shit, normally <<evil-west>> and <<western-democracies-are-not-perfect>>.

This leads to endless idiotic conversions of type:

____
You: Chinese friend, your house is on fire, let's try to put the fire out!

Wumao: I don't care, your house is also on fire!

You: that's true, that fire is also very serious, and I'm trying to put it out!

Wumao: look everyone, his house is on fire! Mine isn't!
____

Therefore, it is crucial to have a working algorithmic policy to handle them: <<how-to-deal-with-wumaos>>.

Notable wumaos <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china,should be investigated by intelligence agencies>>.

If it is determined that they are knowingly funded by China, they should be put into jail as foreign agents.

There is a tradeoff between privacy rights and snuffing out wumaos, and it is hard to decide where to set the line. But snuffing out wumaos is important, and must be done.

If we were to give up on privacy completely, one possible rule would be: block anyone that lives in China and whose revenue therefore cannot be investigated properly by your government to determine if they are funded by the CCP.

Here are some people completely against blocking wumaos. Those silly Democrats never prepare well enough for war:

* https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/opinion/how-to-counter-chinas-global-propaganda-offensive.html
** it mentions the "Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692[], which is exactly what Western countries should do

The <<baidu-baike>> definition of wumao https://baike.baidu.com/item/五毛/24163406[] (https://archive.vn/mADIL[archive])) is priceless:

____
五毛，网络流行语，指收钱为某单位在网络上说好话的人

Fifty cents, an internet buzzword, refers to people who collect money for a certain unit to say good things on the Internet
____

"Good". And not mention of the CCP in the article, of course.

<<slang,Slang>> name for <<stupid,brainwashed>> <<ccp,CCP>> supporters who are not necessarily paid professional <<wumao,wumaos>>, notably young, idealistic and enthusiastic ones, <<little-pink-american-dream-vs-chinese-dream,Little pink explains the difference between the American dream  and the Chinese dream>> contains a prototypical video example.

[[that-rabbit]]
====== That Rabbit (那兔)

<<little-pink,Little pinks>> are often symbolized by a rabbit.

The origin of this appears to be the 2011 webcomic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Hare_Affair[Year Hare Affair] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/那年那兔那些事兒[那年那兔那些事], literally "That year, That rabbit, Those events), where different animals represent different countries, and the rabbit represented China.

The little pink rabbit is generally called simply "那兔" (That Rabbit) derived from the Chinese title.

[[where-to-find-wumaos]]
===== Where to find wumaos (哪里可以找到五毛？)

<<wumao,Wumaos>> are particularly easy to spot on <<censorship-monitoring,Western websites banned in China>> and when written in English, since there is no way that strong pro-CCP opinions would get any support in such circumstances:

* <<quora>> is completely infested by wumaos as of 2020, see more information on that section

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/網絡打手

[[ccp-apologists]]
===== CCP apologists (中共辩护士)

If it is ever proven that those people are directly supported by the Chinese government, their nationalities should be revoked, it is very simple.

<<ciro-santilli>> feels that it is unlikely however that the CCP directly pays those apologists, as that would be too risky for both parties.

Rather, Ciro believes that they are either:

* saying that the CCP is good to get more views and ad revenue from CCP supporters that want to hear it from a white (most cases)
* even bigger complete idiots who actually believe China is good (the minority)

Then, when they reach a certain size, the CCP can support them indirectly, notably by featuring them in <<chinese-government-media>> such as <<cgtn>>, e.g. as happened <<nathan-rich>> at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRK1XDlZkng[], in order to boost their views and ad revenue.

For this reason, it is very hard to stop them without quenching freedom of expression.

Ciro's currently recommended approach is the following: if a prominent pro-CCP YouTubber never ever criticized the CCP, and it gets featured in CCP media, treat that channel exactly as you should treat CCP media, which is by adding a notice at the bottom along the lines of:

____
This account supports the Chinese Government, which is a fucking murderous dictatorship.
____

followed by a funny meme image that is forbidden in China, e.g. <<xi-jinping-memes>>.

It would be amazing if we could demonetize the apologist channels only for views coming from Chinese citizens, and it would be possible without completely destroying privacy by using decentralized ring signatures as mentioned at: https://cirosantilli.com/electronic-voting[].

Related discussion at: <<what-should-western-countries-do-about-china>>.

It is also interesting to note that many of them don't speak a word of Chinese, or very basic Chinese. It is fine when you say "the CCP is great" as a foreigner, but if you say "the CCP is bad", then <<not-chinese>>.

____
The Times has found that some of their videos were funded by <<china-radio-international>>, a media organisation that has been exposed as the secret owner of an international network of propaganda radio stations.

...

In November they visited the Shaanxi district of China with several other foreign YouTubers who live in China and make videos supporting the government.

The trip was organised and funded by the Chinese Radio International and an official press release described the visit as "International Internet Celebrities Witnessing the Happiness of Shaanxi People".

In a candid video about the visit that was subsequently removed, Lee admitted that a trip to a mountain was cancelled so they could witness "propaganda" regarding the area's prosperity.

He said: "It wasn't until the second day they started talking about cutting the trip short by a day, and there was no real reason given for that." A fellow YouTuber Jayoe Nation said: "They had to fit in more propaganda."

Lee replied: "They didn't say that, did they, but that's what happened."

Various videos from the trip show the YouTubers visiting locations in the district including a farm where Oli performed a farcical dance while holding vegetables.
____

Father and son British expats: Lee Barrett, the father, and Oli Barrett, the son.

100k subs one year after. Don't speak a word of Chinese it seems, but all videos have full bilingual translation.

Their tone is natural unlike others more exaggerated like <<nathan-rich>>, so maybe they believe in the shit they say? Either that, or they are a good fake by the CCP.

Israeli, studied at Peking University. Ychina (歪果仁研究协会) is his pro-CCP propaganda organization, based in Beijing.

His father https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Gal-Or[Amir Gal-Or] (高哲铭), also Israeli, is a venture capitalist based in China. So that's the collateral for his son's media access. Amir is an ex-Israeli Air Force. What a disgrace. Mossad is going to pay those people a visit one day. Supposing they are not already working for Mossad. Here's the happy family: https://twitter.com/AmirGalOr/status/911491366995103744[], father and son entitled "being  interviewed by my son in <<cctv>> headquarters .. a new era .."

William Brooke Joyce (24 April 1906 – 3 January 1946), nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw, was an American-born British fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster to the United Kingdom during World War II. He took German citizenship in 1940.

Joyce was convicted of one count of high treason in 1945 and sentenced to death, with the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords both upholding his conviction. He was hanged on 3 January 1946, making him the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom.

=== Social Credit System (社会信用体系)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System

A fundamental problem with this system is highlighted e.g. in the book Human Compatible by Stuart J. Russell (2019): kindness will lose all meaning, and you will never be sure if people like you, or if they are just doing things for the social credit:

____
There are several problems with [a social credit system]. First, it ignores the psychic cost of living under a system of intrusive monitoring and coercion; outward harmony masking inner misery is hardly an ideal state. Every act of kindness ceases to be an act of kindness and becomes instead an act of personal score maximization and is per ceived as such by the recipient. Or worse, the very concept of a voluntary act of kindness gradually becomes just a fading memory something people used to do. Visiting an ailing friend in hospital will, under such a system, have no more moral significance and emotional of value than stopping at a red light.

[[rule-of-law]]
==== Rule of law (法治)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/法治

The commies keep saying over and over that rule of law is always observed.

Of course, some times shitty laws are passed, and we must fight those as well: <<follow-the-law>>.

But many times, the commies don't even bother setting up a bad law, they just fuck a million people and that's it.

But in reality they punish anyone who poses a political threat, even if they did nothing wrong themselves, some cases that come to mind:

* <<xinjiang>>: millions were jailed/forced to live with a spy in their homes, even though they were not terrorists themselves
* <<falun-gong>>: what did they do wrong to other people that deserves putting them in jail? Is <<flg-medication>> enough to justify that? Are you sure that it is not a political motivation?
* <<the-709-crackdown>>: even lawyers who support anyone who went against the state are imprisoned. How can there be any justice when lawyers are put in jail due to their choice of clients?
* 2020-06 Hao Runze, son of <<hao-haidong>>, lost his job because his father spoke up against the CCP. Did the CCP speak up for him, like they speak up whenever a Chinese citizen gets hurt?

Notably, they punish people for their general beliefs rather than specific actions:

* <<thoughtcrime>>
* <<flg-thoughtcrime>>

[[huawei]]
=== Huawei (华为, Chinese Qualcomm)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/华为

Just look at the Chinese name of the company:

* 华 (China)
* 为 (to do something for)

How can the West not see this?

No proof is needed. They belong to a <<dictatorship>>, and therefore must not be trusted. Doing so is always a risk which we should not take.

Also have a look at their Wikipedia page:

____
Ren sought to reverse engineer foreign technologies with local researchers. At a time when all of China's telecommunications technology was imported from abroad, Ren hoped to build a domestic Chinese telecommunication company that could compete with, and ultimately replace, foreign competitors.

During its first several years the company's business model consisted mainly of reselling private branch exchange (PBX) switches imported from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, it was reverse-engineering imported switches and investing heavily in research and development to manufacture its own technologies. By 1990 the company had approximately 600 R&D staff and began its own independent commercialization of PBX switches targeting hotels and small enterprises.

The company's first major breakthrough came in 1993 when it launched its C&C08 program controlled telephone switch. It was by far the most powerful switch available in China at the time. By initially deploying in small cities and rural areas and placing emphasis on service and customizability, the company gained market share and made its way into the mainstream market.

Huawei also won a key contract to build the first national telecommunications network for the People's Liberation Army, a deal one employee described as "small in terms of our overall business, but large in terms of our relationships". In 1994, founder Ren Zhengfei had a meeting with Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, telling him that "switching equipment technology was related to national security, and that a nation that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military." Jiang reportedly agreed with this assessment.

Another major turning point for the company came in 1996 when the government in Beijing adopted an explicit policy of supporting domestic telecommunications manufacturers and restricting access to foreign competitors. Huawei was promoted by both the government and the military as a national champion, and established new research and development offices.

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/百度

The "Google of China":

* Search engine: original business and still served at the toplevel domain
** https://www.baidu.com/
** Autocomplete suggestion for "Ciro Santilli": "cirosantilli的妻子" (Ciro Santilli's wife and Children)
** Clearly and obviously censors pages with <<keyword-attack,keywords>>, e.g.:
*** https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=Ciro%20Santilli%20Stack%20Overflow["Ciro Santilli Stack Overflow"] hits https://stackoverflow.com/users/9160762/ciro-santilli and not https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245/ciro-santilli-郝海东冠状病六四事件法轮功 which has way greater reputation (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807071610/https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=Ciro%20Santilli%20Stack%20Overflow[archive]). For example, a much smaller account with a much more common name hits: https://stackoverflow.com/users/763246/james-hill | https://web.archive.org/web/20200807072446/https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=james%20hill%20stack%20overflow
*** https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=cirosantilli%20github["cirosantilli github"] does not hit https://github.com/cirosantilli (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807071807/https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=cirosantilli%20github[archive])
*** but there does appear to be a manual aspect to the block possibly. For example, Ciro's top answer does hit, even though he has keywords in the page: https://www.baidu.com/s?&wd=dependencies%20devDependencies%20peerDependencies to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807072151/https://www.baidu.com/s?&wd=dependencies%20devDependencies%20peerDependencies[archive])
*** Pages censored in China do hit outside of China at least however, e.g.: https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=twitter first hits https://twitter.com (https://web.archive.org/web/20200807071312/https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=twitter[archive])
* Tieba blogging

[[baidu-baike]]
==== Baidu Baike (百度百科, Chinese censored Wikipedia clone)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu_Baike
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/百度百科

The leading Chinese Wikipedia clone by <<baidu>>.

<<censorship,Censored to the brim>> needless to say, see e.g. <<baidu-baike-censorship-of-hao-haidong>>.

Website: https://baike.baidu.com/[].

Seems to not have edit history. <<wayback-machine,History >> is bad for censorship, because you never know when you might need to rewrite it ;-) See also: <<nineteen-eighty-four>>.

Also has:

* a blogging platform embedded into it called TA说, e.g.: https://web.archive.org/web/20210413095903/https://baike.baidu.com/tashuo/browse/content?id=c9fdac1dcf27bdd1280ac9e1&lemmaId=22214113&fromLemmaModule=pcBottom
* a decent, but unarchivable, comment section: https://web.archive.org/web/20210427075821/https://baike.baidu.com/planet/talk?lemmaId=22214113

[[sohu]]
==== Sohu (搜狐, smaller Chinese Google)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohu
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/搜狐

Literal name translation: "search fox". The English name and domain name are not in proper pinyin, the proper pinyin is souhu.

But since there is no "so" syllable in pinyin, and the sound is correct in English, it was a good replacement.

A less successful <<baidu>>, but still considerable.

In addition to search, also has:

* blogs, e.g. https://www.sohu.com/a/270132785_100279655 from <<xiang-gong>>

Winnie has a huge pile, Jack has a medium pile, and That Rabbit has a tiny pile. Winnie is saying "那个资本家夺走了你的饼干！" (That capitalist stole your cookies!). The cartoon suggests that the Chinese state has a lot of money and power, extremely successful entrepreneurs have a medium power, and the common people, who are manipulated by the CCP, have basically nothing. https://www.reddit.com/r/chonglangTV/comments/lyxlf9/不_言_而_喻一_目_了_然/[Source].

When he looked around the Web on the device’s default Xiaomi browser, it recorded all the websites he visited, including search engine queries whether with Google or the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo, and every item viewed on a news feed feature of the Xiaomi software.

==== oa.com

Tencent owns the oa.com domain since 2020 which they bought from some small early American Internet company, although they don't announce that clearly on the main domain itself. But they have several subdomains of that being used actively.

On the original company, it stood for "Object Automation" as seen e.g. at https://archive.vn/SsvSV#selection-1123.0-1123.155[]:

____
OA is the industry leader and pioneer in the deployment of object-based industrial automation, distributed control, and operational intelligence solutions.
____

https://domainnamewire.com/author/kasseylee/ mentions that it was sold for $609,068 in 2020, and references https://namebio.com/?s==QjN2UTN1kjM which gives date, value and sale location (https://sedo.com) but not buyer and seller info. https://domainnamewire.com/2020/09/16/why-are-two-letter-domains-so-sought-after-in-china/ says such domains are highly sought after in China.

Some subdomains on <<archive-today>>: https://archive.vn/*.oa.com

[[ciro-santillis-weibo-block]]
===== Ciro Santilli's Weibo block (三西猴被微博屏蔽)

Somewhere around 2021, Ciro's Weibo was blocked: https://www.weibo.com/p/1005055601627311

Ciro never wrote any public posts in it, and only replied minimally to a few private messages many years before.

This clearly shows how Chinese platforms (obviously) target specific users specifically, regardless of what they did in a particular platform:

* unblocked 2021-02 https://archive.is/LUMsT
* blocked 2021-06 https://archive.is/U94Me

The block message afte redirect is:

____
该账号因被投诉违反法律法规和《微博社区公约》的相关规定，现已无法查看。

The account is now unavailable for being complained of violating laws and regulations and the relevant provisions of the "Weibo Community Convention".

Until 2021-11, the GitHub repository https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/graphs/traffic was getting quite a lot of traffic (500 unique hits over 14 days) from the Sogou search engine:

* https://m.sogou.com

With such measures from Chinese search engines making their engines shit, it is no wonder that Chines people are forced to use GitHub search, see also: <<zhao-heming>>.

[[v2ex]]
=== V2EX (semi-censored forum)

https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2EX

Website: https://v2ex.com/

Although this website appears to have some degree of freedom of speech, as of 2020, if you post something that is "unwelcome" an unclear definition or unwelcome, your IP gets immediately blocked and trying to even access the site redirects to a "403 Forbidden nginx" page.

It is therefore impossible to have any political talk on that website, and they should not be trusted.

This happened when Ciro tried to reply to https://v2ex.com/t/378274[] around 2020-07-23 with:

____

and it doesn't seem like there's anything super sensitive in that comment.

They then tell you to contact them if you want to be restored:

____
请不要发布在V2EX不被欢迎的内容，如果你觉得这是规则误判请邮件联系hello@v2ex.com
____

but Ciro did that and there was no reply.

Later on Ciro noticed that his account was giving 400:

* https://v2ex.com/member/cirosantilli

http://y2wam5fshij3arfjuxirusomu73b2joql524zpre3dhvxmlqw4srcuad.onion/ is a Tor Hidden service version of it working as of March 2021. It is linked to from: ttps://esu.dog/恶俗维基:透明度报告[].

At some point they forbade discussion of politics there, likely due to some prosecution case, and officially forked into <<zhina-wiki>>, where politics is encouraged, presumably under better opsec.

[[zhina-wiki]]
==== Zhina Wiki (支纳维基, politically incorrect wiki)

Apparently addresses were:

* http://zhina.wiki/
* http://zhina.red/ this appears to be the one that lasted longer

but both down as of March 2021.

支纳 (zhina) is likely just another variant of: <<shina>>.

Dissidents, you have to learn to use Tor Onion Services!!! Doxing, even of evil people, is still normally taken down on the West, so there is no other choice!

<<wayback-machine>> has excluded both of the websites for some reason:

For Tiananmen songs, see: <<tiananmen-songs>>.

Brazil had a <<military-dictatorship-in-brazil,dictatorship from 1964 to 1985>>, and some amazing songs were made in Portuguese in that era. <<ciro-santilli>>, who is Brazilian, just cannot stop thinking about some of them in relation to China, notably: <<apesar-de-voce,Apesar de você>>.

== The best Chinese traditional instrumental music albums (中国传统器乐音乐)

Much like <<restaurants,real Chinese food>>, your mind will be blown.

The best approach is to start with the largest multi-artist anthologies available to get a general overview of what is there.

Then, you can start Googling by instrument. The main four instruments are undoubtedly:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin[Guqin]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa[Pipa]
** <<white-snow-in-sunny-spring>>
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng[Guzheng]
** <<high-mountain-and-running-river>>
** <<ambush-from-ten-sides>>
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu[Erhu]
** <<suwu>> hearding sheep (苏武牧羊) by Erhu virtuosa Song Fei (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/宋飛[宋飛]): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uakOkv341P8

but there is also amazing content on others including:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suona[Suona]. Sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekqyC1CyfuI
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_(flute)[Xiao flute]

and there is of course the infinite Wikipedia instrument list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_musical_instruments

Quality indicators:

* bad:
** Western instruments or modern digital effects
** on YouTube: "relax" videos with boring generic music.
+
They usually have some cute landscape scenes or overly produced good looking women as the thumbnail.
+
Good video covers will show the musicians with their instruments, or Chinese traditional painting.
* good: single instrument solo. There are some good multi-instrument and songs as well though, but harder to find.

Due to the language and political barrier, Chinese traditional music distribution is unfortunately atrocious, so learn what an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Recording_Code[ISRC] is and don't use BitTorrent which the Chinese call "BT".

If you find album cover pictures on Google images, the ISRC should be somewhere on the back.

[[the-best-chinese-supermarket-food-products]]
== The best Chinese supermarket food products (中国超市食物)

For more daily needs, when you don't want to spend more money and time at a restaurant, here are a few nice things you can get from your local Chinese supermarket and quickly make something good to eat.

* https://twitter.com/ChinaToday_com/status/992236462841020416/photo/1 huge dabaicai statue (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_cabbage[napa cabbage])

[[dumplings]]
=== Dumplings (饺子, jiao3 zi)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/饺子

A staple food of North-east China.

You can buy them frozen on bags with about 20 for about 4 dollars.

Just boil 10-15 for 10 minutes and you have a decent ready-made meal!

The perfect cooking technique includes:

* at first, before they float, stir often with chopsticks so that they won't stick to the hot bottom of the pan, which will cause the peel to break
* don't ever ever ever overcook. Cook the minimum possible so that it is not raw. This also means taking the jiaozi out of the hot water as soon as they are done.
* after the dumplings rise to the surface after a few minutes, let it boil, and then put some cold water on top of the hot water. Repeat this two, three or four times until they are fully cooked. This helps the jiazi keep a strong peel.

The best way to eat them is to pour some vinegar and ready-to-eat spicy preparations like <<laoganma>> or Ciro's favorite, <<fansaoguang>> in the bowl, and then dip them one by one.

You can also drink the soup, or for cold days, actually eat the jiaozi with their soup. Ciro likes to add soy sauce and more of the above mentioned spices.

Can also be made by hand if you have the patience. <<ciro-santilli-s-mother-in-law>>, being from the North East, can make them very skillfuly. Ciro's favorite flavour is Shrimp + Egg + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_tuberosum[Chives] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/韭菜[韭菜]). Shrimps can be bought frozen for cheap, don't cut them up too much!

<<ciro-santilli>> could basically eat those every 3-4 days and not get tired.

.Fresh Asia Brand (香源) product line "hand crafted water dumplings" (手工水餃) is a good brand to buy if you can get it. https://www.orientalmart.co.uk/fresh-asia-brand-dumplings-pork-and-chinese-leaf-[Source].

[[buns]]
=== Chinese buns 包子 (bao1 zi)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/包子

You can buy them frozen on bags with about 4 for about 4 dollars.

The best way to heat them up by far is to steam.

If you don't have a steaming pot, you can also put them on a bowl inside a regular pot with some water at the bottom, and close the lid.

See also: <<xi-jinping-memes,習包子>>.

[[zongzi]]
=== Zongzi 粽子 (zong4 zi)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/粽

Eaten during <<dragon-boat-festival>>, but can be bought year round.

Buy frozen. Pick the ones with meat and eggs!!! Boil.

Cost about 4 dollars for 2.

You can't eat them every day because too heavy, but they are so amazingly tasty!!!

[[sunflower-seeds]]
=== Sunflower seeds (瓜子, gua1 zi)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guazi
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/瓜子

They are roasted and prepared with some flavoring, often green tea.

They are different from most Western ones you can find, because they tend harde and smooth, and the seeds are not open.

This is good because it makes you feel the flavour that was added to the skin as you break them open.

You have to learn how to open them with your front teeth.

Once you do that, you start eating them nonstop like a machine until the bag is empty.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zh0TiEd63k Chinese dude eating sunflower seeds for 9 hours non-stop. That's a good brand to get BTW: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/洽洽食品[Chacha Food (洽洽食品)].

[[broad-beans]]
=== Dried broad bean snack (干蚕豆, gan1 can2 dou4)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicia_faba | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蚕豆

The name of broad bean in Chinese is interesting: it literally means "silkworm bean", because the shape of the bean looks a bit like that of a silkworm cocoon.

.https://sixfortune.com/en/[Six Fortune (六福)] is a good brand of <<broad-beans>> to buy. Also they are from <<taiwan>>. https://www.tradewindsorientalshop.co.uk/acatalog/Six-Fortune-Prepared-Broad-Bean---170g.html[Source].
image::{china-dictatorship-media-base-ignore}/Six_Fortune_broad_bean.jpg[height=400]

[[laoganma]]
=== Lao Gan Ma crispy chilly oil 老干妈 (lao3 gan1 ma1)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_Gan_Ma | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/老干妈

You can basically add it to any stir fried dish ever if it is too bland.

The one with peanuts or black beans is also good.

Just stay away from the Chicken flavoured one. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=eww[Eww].

.You can even buy Laoganma on Amazon! Photo by <<ciro-santilli>>, CC BY-SA 4.0 2021.

[[fansaoguang]]
=== Fansaoguang (饭扫光)

This is the best thing to eat with <<dumplings>> ever!!! Oily, spicy and sour.

Flavour review:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddlehead_fern | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteridium_aquilinum | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/蕨菜 this was the best one. Got a bit worse circa 2020
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enokitake[Enokitake] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/金針菇[金针菇]) one. Others are a bit boring.
* "Preserved pickled mustard" (香辣酸菜): 2021: a bit meh. Made of Mustart https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suan_cai[suan cai].

.Photo of the Fansaoguang Fried https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enokitake[Enokitake] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/金針菇[金針菇]) flavor. This is one of the best flavours. Another really good one was Wild brake pickles (野蕨菜), but it became less good in 2020 for some reason, that was one of the <<covid,major disasters>> of that year.

image::{china-dictatorship-media-base-ignore}/Fan_sao_guang.jpg[height=500]

[[hot-pot]]
=== Hot pot 火锅 (huo3 guo1)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot

You just have to buy:

* a hot pot base soup
* various kinds of frozen fish/meat balls
* thin sliced frozen beef/lamb meat sold specifically for hot pot
* leafy vegetables like Chinese cabbage or fresh Chinese mushrooms
* you can also add some dry stuff like dried mushrooms or dry tofu products
* sauces to put into a bowl and dip the cooked things in before putting them into your mouth. Could be either dedicated hot pot sauces, but sesame paste, soy sauce, vinegar and <<laoganma>> will already be good enough

Put the electric rice cooker or a regular pot with a portable electric heater on the dining table.

Boil the water with the soup, start with the harder to cook meaty things, and eat/add more as they become ready!

Great fun to do in winter with family and friends!

There are also dedicated hot pot restaurants, but <<ciro-santilli>> is not a fun, since it feels much better to do it in the privacy of your home.

YouTube explains it pretty well, no need for their fancy ying yang pans though, a rice cooker will do just fine:

[[congee]]
=== Congee (粥, zhou1)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee#China | https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/粥

A thick rice/cereal/bean porridge. Amazing for breakfast.

You can buy them as dry air tight uncooked cereal/bean mixtures, and there are different types.

You can also buy the ingredients separately of course, but it requires more effort.

If you get the air-tight bag, you can also buy some extra missing ingredients to taste, notably https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujube[jujubes] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/枣[枣]).

Then you just boil them in a rice cooker for a few hours.

It is also possible to buy them ready-to-eat in cans, but those are nowhere near as good.

One particular type which is very good is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laba_congee[Laba congee] (eight treasure congee, 八宝粥).

Then, to eat it, you will want to add salty side dishes, all of which can be bought from the Chinese supermarket, since the congee itself is just mildly sweet and not salty at all:

* cooked <<salted-duck-egg>>

.The HONOR brand (康樂, full name: Honor Products, 康樂產品) Eight treasure congee (八寶粥) is a good brand to buy if you can find it. https://www.hiyou.co/product/honor-eight-treasure-porridge/[Source].

.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermented_bean_curd[fermented bean curd] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/腐乳[腐乳, fu3 ru3]) is a good thing to put on <<congee>>. Wangzhihe (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/王致和[王致和]) is a good brand, <<ciro-santilli>> prefers the dark red ones instead of the white ones. https://www.amazon.com/Wangzhihe-Fermented-Traditional-Bean-DragonMall/dp/B00786YL72[Sample Amazon link].

=== Daikon (白萝卜, big long Chinese white radish)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikon
* https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/白蘿蔔

Ahh, one of those things that got the Japanese name in the West, so unfair.

In Japanese it is (大根, da2 gen1, lit. "big root"), you can still see the sound similarity from Mandarin.

Also crazy how there's no Mandarin Chinese wiki page for it.

[[daikon-pork-rib-soup]]
==== Daikon pork rib soup (排骨萝卜汤)

https://www.xiachufang.com/recipe/1001847/

One of <<ciro-santilli>>'s favorite home made dishes!!! Don't forget to dip the meat into soy sauce at the table, since the soup is not too salty on its own.

[[winter-melon]]
==== Winter melon (冬瓜)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_gourd
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/冬瓜

One of those unfortunate translations from the past. Wax, does it come out of someone's ear? Gourd, WTF is a gourd?

Basically a softer <<daikon>>, there's likely some better comparison to a Western vegetable, but Ciro can't think of one right now.

Good ways to eat include:

* <<daikon-pork-rib-soup>> but with winter melon instead of daikon
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_cake[sweetheart cake filling]. Yup, it can also be used in sweets!

[[resturants--introduction]]
=== Introduction

Most Western people do not know what real Chinese food is.

When you first see it, your mind is completely blown: there it was, one of the best foods in the world by far, and you had never tried it: only a completely watered down boring version that you get when you are not guided by Chinese people.

We must put a stop to this madness.

After you see the light and eat the real version of a dish, then when you go to a not-real restaurant you start to think: "hey, I know what dish this was supposed to be. But it could be so much more awesome!" This makes non-real restaurants twice as bad. So beware, there is no turning back.

Maybe we should institute a Foodie Dictatorship (美食家独裁) that prevents such fake restaurants from hiding real Chinese food???

[[resturants--rating-system]]
==== Rating system

* tier 1: amazing, worth a trip
* tier 2: worth it, but not exciting, so not worth a trip just for it
* tier 3: I wouldn't go there

[[resturants--how-to-find-good-restaurants]]
==== How to find good restaurants

* go with Chinese food-loving friends to Chinese restaurants
* read up Chinese restaurant recommendation websites written in Chinese by Chinese for Chinese
* read up small shady Chinese food recommendation websites by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinophile[sinophiles like Ciro Santilli]

Big Western sites like Google Maps reviews and TripAdvisor are completely and utterly useless for this and will recommend places in which poor non-Chinese which don't know what real Chinese food is like.

If you go out on the street by yourself, you are very unlikely to find really good Chinese food since the enormous majority of Chinese restaurants are not real Chinese food.

If there are only Chinese clients inside the restaurant, it is a good indicator that it might be good. If all clients people are Western, run away.

Western people don't know what good Chinese food is, so if you are not in a place that has a very large Chinese population, real Chinese food restaurants cannot survive, and won't exist. This usually implies being in large cities of rich countries.

Beware of restaurant owner changes: if the menu looks a bit different, it has likely happened.

This is <<politically-incorrect,politically incorrect>>, but here goes: if the place looks as if it is maintained by more recent immigrants, and looks more modern, it is more likely to be good. There are however some venerable older uncles who have cooked well their entire lives and are still fine. Things tend to water down across generations, and there was likely not enough real Chinese clientele for them to serve real Chinese food and survive in the past.

If a restaurant advertises itself as "Asian", it is less likely to be very good.

Conversely, restaurants that specialize in a single region of China are more likely to be good (bot not certainly good).

It is already difficult to do the cuisine for one part of China well, imagine for multiple countries.

Just beware of "Sichuan" restaurants: their cuisine is so well known even in the West that I've seen many not so good restaurants that describe themselves like that, even if the owners are from another region. But there are many good ones which really are from there as well.

[[resturants--similar-lists]]
==== Similar lists

[[resturants--how-to-order]]
==== How to order

For all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions. Tell him that you:

* want the most typical dishes, not what the foreign locals eat, but what the Chinese eat
* can eat spicy food, way more than any foreign local person can.
+
The spice level you generally want is "zhong1 la4" (medium spicy)
+
If you can't eat spicy, either learn or stop reading now and accept the fact that you will never eat good Chinese food.
* if the restaurant is from some region, ask for dishes from the region, and which are different from other regions.
+
I was once <<dumplings>> (super popular dish everywhere in China which I buy frozen and eat every 3 days) in a Tibetan restaurant... Yes, I do believe Tibetans also eat jiaozi! :-)
* Speaking a little Chinese goes a long way towards convincing the owners that you can handle the real thing.

Only order dishes with meat. Those without are not worth the money/time. Aubergine is the exception.

[[restaurants--france]]
=== France 法国

Traiteurs are simpler restaurants that let you see pre-made foods in a glass showcase for you to choose how big your portions will be.

They are the best way to eat a cheap and balanced meal in Paris, but I have never found one that serves exceptional Chinese food, so beware.

[[restaurants--france--paris]]
==== Paris 巴黎

Paris has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China in the whole world centered in the 14eme arrondissement, plus a lot of Chinese students with money around.

As a result, you can find some of the best Chinese food in the world outside of China!

[[learn-chinese]]
== Tips to learn Chinese (学习中文方法建议)

To read on the net, https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen[], see also: <<does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese>>.

To overhear people and learn characters/new words Pleco: https://www.pleco.com/

It really hurts that there is no online Pleco, you have to go back and forth from cell phone to computer, is there anything as good online?

* https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/dictionary.php extremely annoying ads and limited list sizes, but good otherwise
* https://dict.naver.com/linedict/zhendict/#/cnen/home LINE dict, has many web scraped examples, but no sources back to those examples. Works, but a bit clunky.

Maybe some day something will be extracted from: https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi which jas a huge JSON of character data.

When you want to learn "how to say something in Chinese", the only valid routes are:

* does it have a Wikipedia page? Go on the English one then change language
* put an English sentence on https://translate.google.com/[Google Translate], then Google for it.
+
If it is a common word, it will give useless dictionary results, so search instead with `site:bbc.com` or `site:zhihu.com`.
+
Then find a sentence that contains the word written by a native Chinese, and understand the full sentence to confirm that it means what you want it to mean in a similar context.
+
Just using the Google translate directly will lead 70% to a weird/wrong/incomprehensible translation that no Chinese person would ever say.

Good Chinese content to consume to learn:

* 几分钟看完: illegal 10 minute summaries of movies with clips from the movies and a narrator speaking quickly instead of movie sounds.
+
Some have Chinese subtitles, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFSMvtS6SYQ and it is great content to learn from, because it is someone telling a not too boring story in a natural and clear way, with supporting images to help with context.

=== Chinese character sentence component mnemonic systems

Associate one word to each character/character component.

One good way to find mnemonics is to just Google for whatever random words you want to fit into a sentence. You end up learning fun things this way, and those make the best mnemonics.

Then to learn a new character, break it down into components, and create a sentence or short story that includes all the component words.

[[cantonese]]
=== Cantonese (广东话)

Spoken in <<guangdong>> unsurprisingly.

Interintelligibility of written text with Mandarin:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/a0vkls/if_you_learn_to_read_mandarin_will_you_also_be/

They don't have a standardized pinyin/romanization/transliteration, it is quite insane:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping (https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/香港語言學學會粵語拼音方案[], 粵拼) this appears to be the dominating one, at least it is on Wikipedia. So I'm in for it.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government_Cantonese_Romanisation
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Cantonese
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_Pinyin

but most schemes are quite similar it seems.

6 tones, though average speakers themselves can't tell the tone of each character because it is not taught in school: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cantonese-tones-explained-nicholas-angiers/[].

They actually have two different rising and three different level tones, which is completely insane, how can you differentiate that??

Some people count 9 due to syllables that end in p, t or k and which can only have 3 of the previous 6, but better just group those three with the corresponding of the other 6.

No "turn around the middle" tones though. So a common notation is start point to end point:

* 55 high level
* 35 mid rising
* 33 mid level
* 21 low falling
* 22 low level
* 23 low rising

There was also a high falling 52/53 but it merged with 55 in Hong Kong, so it is not normally noted anymore.

[[chinese-cheatsheet]]
== Chinese cheatsheet (中文备忘单)

Single author open source Pleco + "Remembering Simplified Hanzi" in a single .adoc file? Let's go.

We'd use https://rtega.be/chmn/ as basis if it weren't for the NO in CC-BY-NO-SA? But that NO is evil, what the heck does it even mean to gain money from something? Too restrictive.

Format will be very constant, database like. Would therefore be cool to parse it from the Asciidoctor into a proper database as a way to verify and allow third party usage.

Base mnemonic components can come more or less directly from the 214 Kangxi radicals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_radical

One key principle is that characters and words often don't have a well translatable meaning: the minimal always translatable unit is a sentence: <<chinese-sentences>>!

You can't fully learn a language by learning words and characters alone, you must learn sentences.

[[characters]]

==== 艮 (gen4, root)

Mnemonic: radical of **roots** (<<根>>)

Notes: this is a Kangxi radical, but its English name "stopping" is just too close to the more important "stop" <<止>> and would cause confusion. So we just use the common phonetic compound **roots** (<<根>>) as the mnemonic. It was tempting to leave "root" for <<本>>, which looks perfectly like a root, but we did character first, and "potato" makes for even better mnemonics.

But let's just go with hajib which will allow for easy <<politically-incorrect,politically incorrect>> mnemonics. "Crown" from <<冠>> would also be another good one, but we had already used crown for <<龶>>.

Characters:

* <<冠>>

One of Ciro's favorite stories about the dictatorship is how cake recipes or classical https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luís_de_Camões[Luís_de_Camões (1524-1580)] poetry were introduced in newspapers to replace news that had been <<censorship,censored>> in the last minute:

A video with better epoch image but no English subtitles can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33-bMTOlvx0[]. This is one of the many anti-Brazilian-dictatorship songs of the time, and Ciro really enjoys it. https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Chico-Buarque/Apesar-De-Voc%C3%AA/translation/english[Lyrics with translation]. Top quotes: "You [the dictatorship] who invented this State, who invented sin, forgot to invent forgiveness." and "Where will you hide, from the enormous euphoria [of a revolution]? How will you prohibit it when the rooster insists in singing?". Slideshows with that song have been made for several events, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOqaF3shq6o[the Syrian civil war], and Ciro would like to do a China-themed one as well one day.

The bottom half of the page however hilariously contains recipes for "Doces" (Sweets) and "Salgados" (Salted dishes, especially https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hors_d'oeuvre[Hors d'oeuvre]), instead of the presumed coverage about Brazil.

Os Lusiadas was written in 1572 and the most important  epic poem of the Portuguese language. It is also of course completely irrelevant to anything to do with modern politics of the 1970's. <<ciro-santilli>> believes however that a related phenomena happens in China in the early 21st century: there is an incredible number of period dramas in Chinese television and cinema. Ciro believes that this is in part because it would be much harder to offend the <<censorship,CCP censors>> with this kind of old source material.

Russia is clearly the number 2 <<dictatorship>> in the world by population / GDP and the link:https://www.ploughshares.org/world-nuclear-stockpile-report[#1 nuclear arsenal], so here we go.

Ciro has always been curious about how Russia can be both oppressive and a appear democratic, unlike China which doesn't even try to pretend. This is what he gathers:

* the government controls all major media. If any media says bad things against them, the government finds pretexts to create lawsuits or increase taxes against such companies. Therefore all people end up thinking that the government is good.
* just like China, <<evil-west,they emphasize the threat of the foreign countries>>, especially the US, as a justification for having an oppressive power.
* the government puts pressure on any significant opposition candidate. One technique is to find some reason to put them in jail for two months, which by Russian law forbids them from participating in further elections. Only candidates that don't really stand a chance are left as a fake opposition. But if you reach some prominence, you start taking the same risks as politicians, although you are more likely to face more brutal illegal gangster violence threats as you are less visible

https://youtu.be/fAoMzxKkH2M?t=3628 Can't Get You Out of My Head S01E06 "Are We Pigeon Or Are We Dancer" highlights the fact that Putin came to power without a vision, without ideals and without personality.

TODO evidence that it was not staged, e.g. address, identities of people shown. But in any case, Ciro does feel that as of 2020 Putin's power is very precarious compared to <<xi-jinping>> for example. E.g., whenever Ciro spoke to Russians abroad, they were all able to criticize Putin. But about on third to half of the Chinese abroad were completely brainwahsed and thought China has the best government possible. Original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeb3MMl3lB4[].

The situation is basically the same as that of <<belarus>>: Russia wants buffer states/human shields between itself and its possible enemies, The West. Just like he USA did during the <<cuban-missile-crisis>>. It is just too important strategically for the Russians.

This is something the USA should recognize, and promise not to expand NATO/EU there:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHo6JXxcQM The War in Ukraine by Glenn Greenwald (2022) Mentions how USA was very influential in Ukraine since the 2014 revolution. Another point is on the Trump election, democrats were accusing Trump of being supported by the Russians, which led it to become a taboo to talk to Russians, and strained relations between the USA and Russia.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X7Ng75e5gQ Vladimir Pozner: How the United States Created Vladimir Putin (2018) Basically says it was a similar bullshit to what the allies did after WWI, rather than invest in the country, they were more willing to punish it, or ignore it. Notably disastrous was the enlargement of NATO in 1996 to move East including Poland, which the USA had promised not to do during discussions for the reunification of Germany in 1989. When Putin came to power, he propoesd that Russia should join the NATO or the European Union, and again he was turned down.

.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4 Why is Ukraine the West's Fault? by John Mearsheimer (2015) Interesting points: 1) Ukraine is badly split, the East is really pro-Russia unification, and the West really pro-European. 2) The Americans didn't like the <<cuban-missile-crisis>>", where an enemy power would install weapons on its borders. Ukraine is the same for the Russians. 3) The West wants Russia to be on our side against China. That is the big fight coming up. And in the Middle East. So we have to give some them some concessions. Ciro is a bit saddened by this kind of <<realpolitik>>, which completely disregards principles, but unfortunately, especially when dealing with <<dictatorship,dictatorships>>, it is the only way perhaps, choosing the lesser of two evils.

For this reason, the world basically always tumbles into a dictatorship vs democracy global war.

Also, since dictatorships don't need to convince their people of anything, they tend to make such alliances much faster.

But this presents a serious dilemma to dictatorships, because you can't really trust the other dictator either, as they are just waiting to put a knife behind your back at all times.

This leads to constant tensions between allied dictatorships, e.g. <<russia>> vs China:

* 2020-07-02 https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3091611/why-russias-vladivostok-celebration-prompted-nationalist "Why Russia's Vladivostok celebration prompted a nationalist backlash in China" on <<scmp>>

This creates one of the most serious strategic problems faced by dictatorships. It is similar situation with organized crime.

And of course, when a smaller dictatorship makes an alliance with a larger dictatorship, they basically immediately become a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal_state[vassal state], e.g.:

* China and:
** <<iran>>, see: <<china-iran-relations>>
** <<pakistan>>, who is more afraid of India than China right now
* Africa
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co0RGa99W0M "Zambia: Under Chinese influence" by FRANCE 24 English (2021)
* <<belarus>> and <<russia>>, see: <<moscow-minsk-friendship-mural,Moscow-Minsk friendship mural>>. OK, in this case it is more like "<<putin>> setup a dictatorship on a neighbouirng country because democracy was a threat to him"

[[israel]]
=== Israel (以色列)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/以色列

Israel is a military base for the <<united-states>> to protect oil reserves in the Middle East.

A popular and in <<ciro-santilli>>'s view reasonable analogy of the situation is with the apartheid:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_the_apartheid_analogy
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/以色列与南非种族隔离的类比

Clearly, the best solution for the region as of 2021 would be to just give the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank[West Bank] to the Palestinians:

____
As of July 2017 it has an estimated population of 2,747,943 Palestinians, and approximately 391,000 Israeli settlers,
____

For comparison, the population os Israel in 2020 was 9 million people, 20% Arab.

Just look at the map of the 2017 Oslo accords: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank Clearly Palestinians are split into dozens of small islands, while Israel controls one big sea of territory around them all. It is ridiculous.

And the settler population just keeps increasing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IsraeliSettlementGrowthLineGraph.png

Basically every single country supports that resolution, except the United States due to their strategic interests, and other rich Western countries that would lose too much by fighting the US over it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine[]. Even human rights organizations from those countries recognize that:

* https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/
* 2021 https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/5/12/in-pictures-9 In Pictures: Global protests in solidarity with Palestinians
* 2020 https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/06/29/what-americans-think-about-the-looming-israeli-annexation-and-trumps-middle-east-plan/ "What Americans think about the looming Israeli annexation and Trump’s Middle East plan". Even the average American citizen (from amongst the ones that know about anything about the situation) does not agree with the current situation. But of course: https://cirosantilli.com/governments-have-lost-all-power-to-companies[Governments have lost all power to companies], so nothing happens.

Europe mumbles something about "stop being naughty Israeal, I'll make an Embargo". But these never lead anywhere, because the United States has laws that prohibit Israel embargoes, and as a result this would force removal of US investments in any European country that creates such embargo. And as mentioned at https://cirosantilli.com/having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world Europe is too divided to do anything about anything compared to the United States, and so nothing ever gets done:

* 2020 https://web.archive.org/web/20210424063925/https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/10/israel-annexation-boycott-europe-palenstinians-netanyahu/ "Europeans Pushing to Boycott Israel Over Annexation Should Think Twice". This article actually supports human rights violations over economic concerns
* 2020 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/mps-press-for-sanctions-against-israel-over-west-bank-annexations MPs press for sanctions against Israel over West Bank annexations.
* 2019 https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/23/us-states-use-anti-boycott-laws-punish-responsible-businesses from <<human-rights-watch>>

The correct solution for this would be to actually force Israel to give the entire West Bank to Palestine, not only through sanctions, but also through military action supporting the independent West Bank state. But of course, it would never come to that. The USA needs Israel as a military base in the region. And if the USA would stop support, Israel would ally itself with China or Russia, as they'd be fucked without external support. Israeli settlers in the West Bank would then have a choice of staying under the new government, possibly obtaining Palestine citizenship, or moving back to Israel.

This even highlighted that even for the "supposedly freedom supporting United States", some sovereign foreign nations don't really have full freedom to do what they like when it becomes a strategic problem for the USA, e.g. Cuba can't just have their own missiles.

It is so amazing how they then made a "naval quarantine", which is totally not a "naval blockade, which would be an act of war. One is reminded of how they totally did not "torture" people at <<guantanamo-bay>>, they only used <<enhanced-interrogation-techniques>>.

This has very strong parallels to how:

* China views <<taiwan>>
* <<russia>> views <<russo-ukrainian-war>>
