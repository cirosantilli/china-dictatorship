I've always been curious to how Russia can be both oppressive and a democracy, unlike China which doesn't even try to pretend. This is what I gather:

- the government controls all major media. If any media says bad things against them, the government finds pretexts to create lawsuits or increase taxes against such companies. Therefore all people end up thinking that the government is good.
- just like China, they emphasise the threat of the foreign countries, especially the US, as a justification for having an oppressive power.
- the government puts pressure on any significant opposition candidate. One technique is to find some reason to put them in jail for 2 months, which by Russian law forbids them from participating in further elections. Only candidates that don't really stand a chance are left as a fake opposition.
- small time social media is fine, but if you reach some prominence, you start taking the same risks as politicians, although you are more likely to face more brutal illegal gangster violence threats as you are less visible

Doing Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia gets you 10 years and put in the same category as ISIS: <https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/russia/campaign-of-terror-for-jehovahs-witnesses/> their website is banned in Russia under the category "Federal List of Extremist Materials" <https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/russia/bans-jw-org-website-blocked/> even China hasn't yet become petty enough to block JW.ORG.  Reading through the court cases used as a legal veneer for this move leads you to the opinion that Russia treats you as a terrorist if you dare express the opinion that the Russian Orthodox Church is wrong.
